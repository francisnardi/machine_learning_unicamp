i received lot feedback article i wrote months ago about changing way perceive things internet things (iot
the gist argument start treating things like people  sense giving right vote responsibility paying taxes  sense thinking way think employee hired fulfill specific function perception smart things needs  people ified will
i thought  nice follow notion formalize exactly things comprises lot things world objects numerous count  things (or   iot things
to define iot thing i’m going employ maslow hierarchy needs  known human psychology paradigm typically displayed shape pyramid fundamental human needs (physiological needs like air food water rising esoteric needs (self actualization expression potential apex
i’ve sketched derivative needs pyramid iot things charting ascent thing actualization

maslow theory suggests basic lower levels met human desire higher levels i suggest similar applies thing needs thing use higher level lower level building block met
at base pyramid basic existence needs thing obviously need power physical mechanism connecting transmitting (such radio material housing functionality
 iot need account interaction environment  the physical conditions thing  operating sensor arctic ice monitoring project  operating subfreezing temperatures wristband activity exercise tracker  able withstand sports impact jostling human sweat rapid changes body temperature  waterproof heat resistant encased lightweight fabric titanium
finally thing thing meet specific need bring value  useful account ability meet functional expectations core existence requirement
once core physical needs things met external connectivity possible security needed  quite clear security key iot adoption needs  addressed individual things  externally accessible
accessibility does mean just connectivity applies things  physically cracked open lack security stored data risk
as we’ve learned comes internet related  exploited  exploited truth really  faced early creation iot device thing iot requires means encode encrypt authenticate data
with security challenges met layer pyramid concerns communication needs noted thing needs physical mechanism connection physical needs layer addresses self expression realm need
in short layer pinpoints takes thing share voice world specifics interface networking addressed layer protocols thing use transport network layers ieee  lowpan protocol language thing speak addressed level communication needs supply thing link i iot equation
the step needs hierarchy pertains data decide thing handle collected information transactions does perform does log data does perform diagnostics function data collected expressed thing
at pyramid smart needs  equivalent maslow self actualization needs thing  expression just single sensor communication gateway  combined constructive properties make thing useful internet things
does contribute analytics exhibit logic does present learned predictive behavior scalable self configuring operating need human intervention necessary thing pass turing test realm exhibits true nature
what i interesting construct initial scope individual iot thing limited single thing
consider individual people join form committees organizations new group  individual entity way single thing combine things create groups networks things regarded complex things
these combined things needs  defined construct i especially like seussian micro macro perspective thinking things data collect evolve information
the reason think way enable use familiar paradigms thing architecture interaction models designed example consider simple question consider purchasing iot thing new thinking answer  stuff consider hire new employee trustworthiness reliability ability work form great basis consideration cases
as people ify things notice perspective shift opens a world paradigms leverage
