here dirty little secret internet things things work use them
as consumer gadgets collect dust tucked away drawer (i admit i large box wearables things i know business devices perform expected turning maintenance heavy money pits
this hard gauge usefulness new innovative hardware thing wo  useful stop working ones love hard working devices serve day soon  obsolete replaced newer better shinier things
and buying new things seduced promises  later saddled buyer remorse
 soon thanks concept called hardwareasaservice (haas we’ll fewer regrets we’ll fewer things thanks haas way individuals businesses consume hardware products changing
hardwareasaservice clearly roots software asaservice business model companies sell packages include hardware software maintenance installation monthly fee under haas customers pay services things consequently haas contracts include service level agreement (sla
here examples
vivint is smart home company offers security sensors smart locks thermostats installation servicing / customer support monthly fee hardware company plans start /month free trial period minimum contract length with more than  million customers  million revenue strategy  working
hitachi recently announced trains service contract with virgin uk  new high speed hitachi trains deal hitachi maintains ownership trains paid based trains reliability
in fact transportation leading edge haas bike sharing programs like nyc citi bike provide access bicycles little /month cities car sharing programs like zipcar and cargo have replaced need car uber recently launched  rates to provide everyday transportation option commuters reducing car ownership needs
even large tech companies starting board earlier month microsoft launched surfaces asaservice allowing business customers pay monthly fee microsoft surface unlimited phone/in store support hardware upgrades hp is reportedly exploring haas plans for device product lines analysts believe apple asaservice subscription based revenue model answer company woes
hardwareasaservice makes sense hardware depreciating asset want example a new car loses nearly  percent value when driven lot cases makes simple economic sense own
haas taps current zeitgeist minimalism where books decluttering  bestsellers and  square foot houses  focus popular tv shows growing sharing economy
there many more advantages customers haas transforms capital expenditure ongoing operating expense also allows accurate cost/value comparisons worth x/month me operating expenses  cheaper shared use especially things  use eg bike/car sharing
there is less worry maintenance because bundled servicing means errors bugs misbehaving gremlins  headache hardware provider included servicing also caps total cost ownership know exactly cost long use it
with haas problems fixed faster sometimes hardware provider paid thing operating (eg hitachi trains incentivizes repair equipment quickly proactively (ie preventative maintenance is less need worry about obsolescence pay service hardware newer cheaper hardware enables provider offer better service encourages upgrade
haas advantages iot companies just software vendors benefited saas haas is easier sell because lowered cost haas contracts generate predictable monthly revenue haas plans create longer customer relationships drive sales bundling hardware software maintenance installation improves margins pricing  function value provided underlying (and diminishing hardware costs words haas  shield endless march hardware commoditization
of course haas completely new  we’ve seen similar transformation saas paved way making subscription services widespread generally accepted haas result recent flood innovation released lowered barriers building hardware cheaper components easier prototyping accessible contract manufacturers newer distribution channels hardware friendly investors
it step evolution product delivery models buying financing renting/leasing haas
the key difference haas pay usage of the service not the asset haas variety names smart home asaservice (vivint trains asaservice (hitachi cars asaservice (zipcar cargo uber etc
in words haas new way thinking haas changes relationship vendor customer extending time transaction long term relationship means customers need pay attention vendors operate vendors need pay attention existing customers
of course haas fit hardware products devices  cheap disposable  expensive they’ll require payment just support cash flow needs (especially startups businesses thrive crowdfunded pre sales
 haas better it
