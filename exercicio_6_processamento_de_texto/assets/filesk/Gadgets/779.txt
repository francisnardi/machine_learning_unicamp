if things like smart contact lenses permanent brain implants things need figure power problem devices need energy collecting processing especially transmitting data    problem anymore thanks new technique called interscatter communication
producing wireless signal strong  detected  feet away costly energy wise you’ve got big day battery recharge easily like smartphone
 tiny devices especially intended use inside body power consideration batteries tiny like just pull pacemaker juice laptop reduces power draw welcome generation smart embedded devices

to end graduate students uw electrical engineering progr created technique eliminates necessity produce wireless signals instead using interscatter device essentially harvest deploy signals receives
it works like device say earpiece transmits special single tone signal carrying data bluetooth frequency interscatter device receives signal allows bounce antenna   manipulated slightly encoding blank signal wi fi altered transmission (really sort distorted reflection  picked phone laptop just like data wi fi

cool right best slight alteration received waves requires power  times efficient producing wi fi signal  times efficient bluetooth

one steps project  miniaturize technology far built bulky fpga boards  design finalized  shrunk ordinary integrated circuit board  signals standard devices  apple watches samsung galaxy phones
