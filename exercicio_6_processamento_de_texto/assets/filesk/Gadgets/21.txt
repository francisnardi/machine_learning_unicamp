nathan copeland telling researcher fingers feels touch  researcher touching robotic hand copeland hand felt thing decade
in proof principle experiment man spinal injury removed sensation limbs able feel pressure robotic digits connected directly brain long way cybernetic hand  opens possibility using need it

that said important research skips step prosthetics rely peripheral nervous need send signals replacement hand plug arm tapping signals gone   spinal injury signals reach brain approach does work
what robert gaunt te university pittsburgh essentially plug robotic arm directly brain bypassing intermediary nerves spinal cord altogether
copeland accident  years ago left a quadriplegic   years operating limbs means remembers feels like hand touched  means brain remembers too
so researchers copeland concentrate feeling having different fingers touched tracked brain activity associated feeling surgically implanted sets fingertip sized microelectrode arrays copeland sensory cortex feelings centered
over months te repeatedly stimulated areas brain finding patterns locations produced sensation touched index finger ring finger eventually copeland hooked robotic hand finger corresponded circuit brain
he got  percent right later nearly  percent highly validating  involved tell early is
the ultimate goal create moves feels just like natural arm gaunt said news release long way to  great start
for thing sensation needs  evened  feels electrical pressure  i tell fingers definite precision copeland said gradations types touch miles off
this way street data passed brain arm control methods rely completely different neural circuitry motor cortex different field research  kind feedback going straight prosthetic brain important intuitive controls allow user grip manipulate things natural way
