gopro started working drones months ago order stake claim in this multibillion dollar market natural for  able offer best flying immersive camera market  completely autonomous pilot required explain  big player emerging drone market
even we’ve seen gopro non event videos appearing web probably communication best technological innovation emerge
a months ago gopro announced buying kolor  degree video software vendor company france kolor developing platform stitching  degree videos coming example different gopro units attached specific mast company  dedicated business unit  degree spherical applications
kolor founder senior director immersive media solutions gopro acquisition gopro is entering market  degree drone images/videos applications  degree camera players market (like bublc panono and giroptic  able natively integrate camera drone for perfect image quality stabilization
immersive video images applications big thing coming market  tried set drone gimbal catch perfect quality stabilized video axes knows nightmare
immersive video camera/drone movement allows benefit immediately panoramic  degree spherical view offer interactive exploration directly inside image real world vr gear is what kolor doing field chrome  degree view

one gopro latest acquisitions is in zürich switzerland gopro entering gps denied navigation space fact taken opportunity establish swiss subsidiary buying skybotix september (a small company engineers coming eth swiss federal institute technology zürich
skybotix has five years experience autonomous drone technology eth also known having spun companies example sensefly  parrot company (the worldwide leader professional drone mapping systems
the skybotix te able send drone inside building pilot reconstructing real time d space constraints technology providing visual navigation application replaces gps accurate camera based positioning multi camera sensors used industrial grade visual odometry real time d reconstruction unstructured indoor outdoor environments
this strategic acquisition gopro  root time new te autonomous systems lab (asl institute robotics intelligent systems (iris technology the two departments belonging eth advanced labs world example achieved far drone

now te directly integrated gopro product division acquisition gopro taking strategic advantage advanced sl applications (simultaneous localization mapping d representation environment used automatic collision avoidance improved user interaction helping operators terms orientation flight planning remember sense avoid key issues faa allow drone systems evolve autonomously pilot line sight
 scenes strategic battle software hardware playing hardware core component in the size/consumption drones building more intelligent applications data power calculation coming integrated multiple sensors like skybotix
qualcomm certainly  major player drone hardware platforms years vast field robotics experience run robotic accelerator promising drone startup
qualcomm recently announced partnership yuneec second chinese ready fly platform (their snapdragon advanced processing power real time flight control leading global navigation satellite gnss optimized support highly accurate location positioning computer vision geometry group eth involved in the advanced development onboard computer
intel intends play major role edison chipset embedded open source hardware computers they partnering drobotics ascending technologies europe build generation autopilots board image processing and sense avoid technology intel funded yuneec  million
then there software intelligence drones lies dos (drone operating words autopilot command control central nervous system
in space have players aiming  the platform leaders airware licensing end end open aerial platform simplify development integration drone applications sensors remote control systems cloud data analysis airware raised  million far closed round to reinvest building emerging drone ecosystem
on open source autopilot platform projects as the linux foundation dronecode project supported companies (parrot intel yuneec led drobotics px project computer vision geometry lab eth zürich again
today the d robotics ecosystem has hundreds contributors world international distributors
in addition players dji coming china dji ready fly drone products manufacturer core model proprietary technology (which provided success 
dji understands they open platform (their sdk limited education simple development want continue lead market develop dji ecosystem like airware closed  million round accel
 big players gopro certainly assets to make best flying camera market bc applications maybe take part in construction new professional applications bb market  surprise joined linux foundation dronecode project months
