what i’ve learned technologies composed understood materials software problems mechanical systems  things engineers doing decades begs question d printing better failure rates high reproducibility difficult clear working exotic materials advanced motion control actually holding innovation think technologies separate pieces elements system
by shifting perspective regarding d printing viewing constituent parts change understanding capabilities typically break following components
the problematic forgotten element ecosystem  the broken pathways meant connect domain old fashioned ways thought prevented truly realizing potential d printing changing think d printing embrace systems nature family technologies begin actually leverage real problems
we designing old technologies printed today designed (either consciously fabrication process just like designing computer numeric controlled machining injection molding additive processes excel leveraged geometry designed specific process efforts develop new design tools allow design better additive processes  progress starts recognizing additive manufacturing just fabrication process strengths weaknesses  considered design
we building prototyping machines current machines generalists specialists prototyping machines designed lowest common denominator performance results machines things  things need change way think purpose machines ask problem solve instead building machine looking problem fits inside need build machines real problems need solving
hardware actually software addition focusing real world manufacturing applications need architect machines leverage software means building smart machines heavily instrumented sensors web connected allow monitoring real time analytics example autodesk ember sensors allow gracefully recover unexpected errors improve print reliability report user completed job allow users check state remotely
materials multimaterial versus mesostructure greatest capabilities d printing technology ability cheaply implement complexity materials designers used certain properties tied types matter material example wooden  piece paper dramatically different properties serve different purposes  ultimately cellulose fibers (wood pulp actually sets apart cellulose organized structured structure larger microcrystalline (tens microns smaller human scale (centimeters meters mesostructure
a common goal d printing  able print multiple materials machine attain multiple properties object design mesostructure allows designs value single material instead relying different materials different performance specific properties designer use multiple mesostructures create object necessary performance characteristics (soft firm elastic breathable using just machine material
with mesostructure principle designers longer need compromise fact design far flexibility capability unlocks huge untapped capability d printers opens new frontiers design
 
 
 
once actually design elements interface corresponding technologies build true manufacturing solutions resulting systems integrate industry learned past  years start applying it
the core technologies holding industry reside is
