as connectivity continues skyrocket  able data fast willing pay price moving faster reliably
current technology/wires fast  data creation consumption quickly catching google fiber offering fastest speeds available regular consumers transfer rate gigabit second hibernia express transatlantic fiber optic cable currently construction use financial markets rate  terabits second (x faster google fiber just faster
we running universal speed limit
there rules universe unfortunately know know information speed limit c speed light light travels  meters second cables mentioned google fiber hibernia express moving data / c (two thirds speed light limited refractive properties glass fiber basically light bounces slows inside cable

for average consumer intense speed needs like financial markets faster transfer does make difference  consider sheer volume data need  moved constantly reliably issue importance incremental steps better infrastructure clear tenth percentage point  hugely impactful
luckily breakthroughs coming quickly albeit great price researchers uk created fiber cables data  percent speed light combined technologies allow incredible  terabits second  gb hd movie downloaded  second cables far efficient short distances work needed
a good way avoid losing speed physical media sending light avoid altogether microwave relays sent (mostly air able travel faster relays  built series stationary towers viability crossing ocean manner make construction challenges proposed series stationary barges holding towers truly sci fi twist network hovering drones transfer signal short distances using lasers
all progress come great cost financial sector typically led charge reliance absolute speeds technologies proven international markets eventually make way general business use
we spending billions development progress slow compared increase speeds previous decades fraction speed light matters expect incredible data  capable producing coming years
