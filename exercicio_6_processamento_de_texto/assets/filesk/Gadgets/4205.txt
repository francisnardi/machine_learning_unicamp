the jetsons presented highly entertaining vision homes future look like animated television anticipated world humans  able just push button
in ways turned  prophetic today have printable food video chats smartwatches robots help housework  flying cars  way the challenge companies integrate digital technologies meaningful ways enhance people homes improve lives
many innovations emerge past years geared kind push button living thanks rise smartphones proliferation cheap sensors possible make just household appliance smart connected  companies expected ship  billion connected home devices bringing  billion revenue seeing connected home devices limited utility scope
take example connected coffee maker pushing button phone turn coffee maker bed convenient  coffee makers built timers existed years making coffee just pain point consumers really going buy new coffee maker download new app minor improvement true lighting flipping light switch cumbersome involved turning lights app
moreover consumers certainly going make kind effort download app appliance home  arduous manage creating work than assemblage devices  controlled smartphones homes future integrate technology seamlessly ways actually impart value  smartphone smart home
limiting reliance smartphones enabling technology recede background requires things sensors  integrated controllable separate device case lighting adding motion sensor makes control light switch app obsolete light turns walks room turns light bulb  actor
second require new interfaces certain capabilities smartphones provide like security homes future replace example right people access homes using key recently smart locks controlled app  biometrical technology enable people surface door recognize members family retina skin structure residents  able communicate directly digitized thing intermediaries
third homes future  smarter today learning algorithms things/devices learn residents preferences use predict behaviors  necessary progr light timer thermostat light knows residents movements behaviors
knowledge preferred setting enables device simulate presence automatically regulate liking devices adapt users habits time create intimate way individualizing home
the major trend shape connected home decades sustainability smart materials make homes leaner energy efficient example smart window glass enabled digitized shades automatically darken sun meaning shutters longer necessary
in addition homes  sustainable addition digital layer multifunctional devices serve platforms make single function devices obsolete instance enhancing light bulb sensors turns security bulb alert security service senses unexpected presence making regular alarms obsolete
people search ways uncomplicate lives homes opposite technology supposed help   simply attaching sensor adding connectivity does automatically make device smarter useful deep integration connectivity sensors applied clear use cases finally distinguish smart home device service just digitized ones
