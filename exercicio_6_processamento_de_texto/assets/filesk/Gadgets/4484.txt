a drone equipped sniff zigbee flew austin neighborhood in early august  devices sign ubiquitous technologies  use day  despite vulnerabilities
the experiment austin mirrored google street view incident  wi fi sniffers exposed home wi fi connections
as connect devices lives i ca help  wonder hackers hurt hunt poach local food production systems
imagine future cities growing  percent america food crazy states like hawaii headed direction and americans produced  percent local food victory gardens wwii locally grown food makes sense improve food nutrition taste reduce pesticide use alleviate greenhouse gases when flash floods hurricanes disasters america stay food secure growing locally plus hipsters like it
since  america actually net importer food  exporting  billion importing  billion countries like mexico china climate resource insecure future growing food locally city warehouses companies like brightfarms new york aerofarms in new jersey suddenly make lot sense masses
 know locally grown food way uses connected sensors automate optimize processes
because i future american city  growing food i’d like know connected gardens small farms future  built today withstand hackers
small scale simply mean keeping small herb garden counter  can mean growing acre food space small shipping container apartment roof new york city
i turned to three tech geeks i know paint future hackers hunt hack poach food
innovators says andrew erlick director hardware design technology indiegogo (previously quirky lean heavily online community order prevent malicious attacks comes gardening i’d envision lot collaborative learning taking place
depending climate seed type fertilizer time year nutrient community driven connected garden  able produce optimum growing recommendations
with human element mind sort breach security  counterbalanced thousands watchful eyes database  living thing breakdown process combination data analysis ecosystem gardeners  able correct mishap turn lead healthy growth erlick explains
luke schantz new york tech evangelist blue man group tells me that future food grown cities need massive networks sensors monitoring environmental conditions possibly modern robotic scarecrows to rats pigeons squirrels course crows feasting nesting urban agriculture
how hackers out
system design the  decentralized each node solar energy panel battery board sensors micro controller reports data  does require network connectivity commands master control progr operate servers hacked given disruption service attack node functioning own
data collection could  like helium where reporting nodes low cost way radios if master control agent message cue blockchain  used ensure control network compromised hacked this could  used updating programing node ensure corrupted updates viruses distributed nodes (as stuxnet virus distributed iranian centrifuges
avoid mono cultures  interesting grow wider variety food types versus mono cultures conventional agro industry cultures supposed be compilations of the best genetic lines like potential targeted attack natural plight mono culture  significant security flaw
amichai yifrach cto flux systems engineer military  years afraid (disclaimer work flux
being hacker says yifrach i concur wireless (more wired connection susceptible attacks answer question ‘is threat real’ yes
he divides threats end equipment attacks server attacks main threats dos (denial service attacks attacker does information  prevents reaching server an mitm (man middle attack attacker gains access network acts man middle pretending  internet (the server server gaining access data packets flying connected device server
for attacks basic threat analysis formula benefit attacker versus effort (time and money required attack agtech user valuable data secret grow recipes unique strains plants user id anonymity user data revenue based ag tech businesses
if applies business what  protect yourself
yifrach suggests hire time experienced hacker te conduct constant monitoring pen testing (penetration testing periodically patch required way stay ahead cat mouse game
and observe server protection techniques
i gladly demonstrate virus i cloud server slowly crawl cage gradually control entire machine (hosting servers companies entire cloud service provider infrastructure says yifrach shared server solutions all i need motive time money bigger attractive large organizations hands data
on end equipment yifrach says ctos observe following techniques
yifrach white hat hacker says demonstrate things make you pale… paranoid
as we lay foundations locally produced food (see edenworks we ca ignore threats potential hackers do pale paranoid  prepared
