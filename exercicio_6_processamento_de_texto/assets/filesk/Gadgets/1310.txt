sticking tiny robots body sounds fun  happens robots run battery start explode   case happen
luckily researchers hokkaido university department chemistry created crystalline assembly moves autonomously exposed blue light means simply flash lights minuscule bots make swim bloodstre intended target
the crystal organic compound azobenzene oleic acid  essentially dye component cooking oil exposed blue light compounds repetitively convert form other
the scientists tested influence structure azobenzene oleic acid crystal contained unequal amounts cis  trans azobenzene wrote researchers
the resulting robots look like  start swimming right conditions feature  useful future implementations micro robotic technology
the ability self organize rhythmic motions repetitive flipping motion observed fundamental characteristics living organisms said researcher yoshiyuki kageyama mechanism  used future develop bio inspired molecular motors robots applications wide areas including medicine
there plans commercialize technologyâ€¦ small light powered robots swimming body sounds lot fun tiny squid like battery powered monstrosities just ask neo
