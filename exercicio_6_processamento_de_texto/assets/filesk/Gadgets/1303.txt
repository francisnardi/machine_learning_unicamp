the security nightmare posed internet things just related to the lack expertise types of companies adding connectivity gizmos gadgets
it sensitivity the connected sensors strewn hither thither opening potential attack vectors determined hackers need really robust security thinking lock risks
to wit wearables
collaborative research conducted te from the department electrical computing engineering at stevens institute technology and binghamton university new york state demonstrated how wearable device smartwatch end compromising user pin thanks motion sensing data generates
the te combined wearable sensor data harvested  key entry traces by  adults algorithm created to infer key entry sequences based analyzing hand movements applying technique different types keypads (including atm style qwerty keypad variants using different wearables (two smartwatches axis motion tracking device
the result were able crack pins  cent accuracy attempt  cent accuracy ties… ouch albeit i guess say wearables useful then
here description work from their research paper
the research reported earlier ieee spectrum one researchers professor yan wang told ieee volume sensors in wearables enables technique work providing sufficient information hand movements clearly more can fact mean less (secure
to eliminate errors trying calculate distance moved based acceleration said te worked backwards from the final movement input sequence likely  pressing enter keypad allowing translate rest key presses
the attack method require hacker  nearby person inputs pin necessary data packets  stolen wireless sniffer placed close keypad capture bluetooth packets sent from the wearable smartphone via malware installed wearable smartphone intercept data send the attacker
and pins are just handful digits te believes technique actually  used power a keylogger
this  extended snoop keystrokes interpret people passwords has been typed professor yingying chen another of researchers involved project told techcrunch research project about this
both smart watches fitness bands pose risk added overall vulnerability
one way avoid risk smartwatch fitness bangle leaking your pin a determined hacker input digits non wearable wearing hand chen confirmed this would prevent technique working
an alternative strategy wear wearable hand enter pins passwords add ‘noise’ to the operation  randomly jerking hand key presses said wang wo look weird
fixing the vulnerability source require wearable manufacturers to better secure sensing data generated devices according wang
he added also obscure signal leaked sensors injecting noise data not  easily reverse engineered
on signal obfuscation wwdc developer conference summer wearable maker apple announced  using a technique called differential privacy on forthcoming version mobile os ios  help obscure individuals personal data  allow large scale trend patterns  inferred analyzing data bulk
safe say security sense having noise with your signal actually  boon
