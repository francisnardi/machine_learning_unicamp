i’m calling peak crowdfunding ratio overcooked concepts to ideas genuinely  called ‘revolutionary’ long skewed crowdfunding platforms  founder pitching revolutionary sponge holder straight face line surely crossed
we’ve peak crowdfunding moments year potato salad springs mind  joke/performance art spongebath ironic i *think* (in fact time writing attracted more  kickstarter pledges looks plausible sanitizing sponge holder making can
it just sponge holder
crowdfunding debt way pre sell idea raise money pay making thing think good idea way figure really is a good idea people vote wallets
on hand democratic arrive at spongebath enthusiastic washing regime changing claims
may  marketing  crowdfunding marketing costs associated producing the thing trying sell unfettered marketing marketing divorced fiscal responsibility sans sanity checking
all need bucks to mock prototype/render more to make video pretend your vapourware already exists  photographing positioned rugged rocks overlooking sun soaked ocean  you go just add liberal sprinkling of marketing buzzwords hit ‘publish’ revolutionary crowdfunding campaign watch pre orders roll not
and recent months techcrunch been sent emails touting…

no really…

and just small sample pitch inbox
thing spongebaths revolutionary toilet cleaners sweat free pants crowding crowdfunding platforms likely entire category  saturated with its tedious noise pollution
perhaps inevitable evolution crowdfunding concept uncorked in a fizzy dre democratized creativity  place where unconventional artists could stretch long legs and round pegged folk fit square holed world  wakes period of delirious euphoria discover the booze has gone flat bunch earnest strangers sitting the living room sofa discussing favorite james blunt songs
this crowdfunding moving inexorably the middle road
it feels akin how early ebay  bogged with identikit mass production inventory playbook bidding sc schemes rule thumb appears be something like ‘if build dross will come’
in pre digital era spongebath well have appeared (now defunct innovations catalogue where earlier iterations such ‘revolutionary’ gizmos  eg extendable window cleaners portable paper shredders snore stoppers size fits galoshes fur lined vibrating golf club covers on on  born ink die paper recycling bin previous year barely thumbed yellow pages
this kind stuff ‘incidental’ ‘incremental’ than innovative joke to call it revolutionary
crowdfunding websites fast becoming the standard bearers the niche clutter aiming to twist buck saturated consumer product spaces often these are products dubious utility just occasionally may be a little ingenious just mundane crowdfunding category synonymous with a sea fantastic plastic attendant tone deaf marketing
sure there gems  dross  sift equivalent  self retracting selfie sticks one raspberry pi desktop computer prototype worth dreaming about that pretty tedious ratio judging pitch emails techcrunch gets crowdfunding platforms awash awful lot of dross days ca  sure because frankly got tired hearing so many nonsensical claims
so real dreamers pitching ideas public cauldron  hoping stand amid sea dross good luck! the rest please think really really long hard contributing noise pollution certainly contributing sense crowdfunding fatigue
