crosley turntables best reputation  vinyl heads all of record players company makes are designed for first time buyers cheap terms price design
the turntable i owned crosley parts plastic did produce great sound played heavy bass tone arm skip around the plastic cover broke months device eventually only produced sound half volume after active year it great device  got hooked vinyl
when i went upgrade better deck i did think crosley it exact problem crosley brand looking tackle newer c series turntables includes models models c series came year (c c newer c announced ces  january
the crosley c success potentially tough sell users like who’ve sub par experience past earlier cheaper models test drive easily argued case for entry intermediate level users

specs

what i like it
the crosely c easy set set turntable platter center install headshell tonearm balance tonearm stylus pressure turntable lid sounds super complicated worry clicks like legos directions easy follow
sometimes setting new turntable balancing tonearm  bit hassle case turntable

the adjustable pitch control is nice touch especially advanced users pitch control allows adjust your pitch tempo djing and it should help device appeal veteran crowd

most crosley turntables look feel cheap  c exception matte black finish dazzling stro dots durable tonearm make sleek look sturdy design
i tested sound quality c number different genres including indie rock pop deep house ambient trap i played sizes records check variances performance i played bose home theater sound quality did not disappoint (even excessively loud volume
at  price right look turntables similar features design you’ll pretty good deal unless trying  professional dj great deck consider buying

what i like it
the built pre amp good  great i tested pre amp pre amp sound significantly better you flip phono switch turntable run the rca cables pre amp better sound results (as case sound good default pre amp   able make it sound better little customization
i wish package came with longer rca cables pre packaged cable is pretty short need buy longer depending home stereo setup fortunately i spare cables huge issue  i causing frustration users
my biggest complaint turntable is happens end record record player does actually turn tone arm does retractable feature this little irritating forces manually stop record player after each listen i’ve  liked record players stop finish stay arm manually retract
bottom line
the crosley c great turntable i highly recommend checking out it market new record player if turntable bought cheaper sturdy want break bank super high end model c great upgrade this professional level turntable  priced designed  way
the design great price fair easy set sounds wonderful advanced features like pitch control want devices shortcomings minor reason i’d pass this device it lacks retractable tone arm
hopefully start bigger crosley attempt lasso advanced users
