in industrial workspace hip area brooklyn construction robotics startup called asmbld is working project that aims change way live indoor spaces
the latest technology to emerge te experienced roboticists dom indoors robotic reconfigure room minutes seriously
 
it looks like cross terminator movie legos little blocks rise floor create walls tables surfaces sink fluid motion
that building materials   inch tiles aluminum studs construct thousands  inch cubes  flat packed stored underneath floor room
little robots live  inch space hidden floor assemble cubes layer time correct location lift place robots battery powered charging dock (similar roomba running low energy
it like d printing upside says asmbld co founder petr novikov
you want conference room startup office  converted lounge weekly hands done
wish studio apartment  bedroom night open workspace day possible too
while dom indoors currently tested smaller scale asmbld talks large working space implement robotic flooring facilities
think business space large conference rooms used day biggest spaces building says bruno araujo asmbld robotics engineer instead wasting resources spaces useful  percent time make space efficient save lot money long term
while sounds complex installation process actually simple asmbld proposes floor space a robotic floor  inches higher existing in approximately time traditional flooring takes
for  square foot room cost  install asmbld reports  savings add fast building owner labor material costs zero each subsequent wall configuration
if robot senses heavier usual alert entire stop moving order prevent safety hazards breaks the pinpoint exact location compromised robot it can  easily removed repaired
from environmental perspective argument reusable spaces obvious construction demolition waste comprises  percent landfill mass  percent building demolition changes tenant requirements physical condition
and does account massive savings time and labor costs replace human workers with dom robots
when building building coordination ca framer plumber electrician different contractors working time says araujo robots doing time structure built just walls electrical conduits lights outlets
in order dom indoors  viable real life plastic tiles  interchangeable variety materials plastic tiled wall thing  tables beds (as demonstrated video clearly require different composition
we expecting people start using right away daily reconfiguration says novikov  weekly monthly reconfiguration completely viable thing right going save lot money make things efficient
