it turns half years developing cozmo tappeiner explained developing sophisticated consumer robots sdk pretty easy create initial kit  built python leveraging million lines code company created plucky little robot letting developers harness complicated actions like facial recognition path planning d modeling simple lines code
anki unsurprisingly big plans executive believes cozmo sdk help open robotics programming to larger audience previously available building systems company developing past years offer users little control access underlying code making potentially useful programmers time coders alike

we interested advancing field robotics says tappeiner industries usually change lab getting huge coverage people non experts contribute industry pre  mobile phones  hardcore developer create app iphone android people arts backgrounds chemistry backgrounds developing apps industries exploding
