the highly technical basis story likely key jacked up journalist trying translate it public panzer law
it natural especially comes stories security privacy apple vs fbi myriad complex technical mechanics play fiercely difficult gordian knots encryption hardware solutions unravel and number previous interactions apple government set precedent another
 matter hard it important stuff right press ability act translator  obfuscator they get able deliver information clearly proper perspective conversation elevated public informed alters course policy making better
when comes court order fbi apple compelling help crack passcode important distinction i’ve seeing conflated
specifically i seeing reports apple unlocked  iphones government reports argue apple refusing fbi times meme is completely inaccurate best dangerous worst
there cases involving data requests government happening moment case new york  apple trying really hard hand customer information tools  case california fighting order fbi intentionally weaken security device allow passcode  cracked brute force separate cases separate things stake
the new york case involves iphone running ios  devices running ios  previous apple actually capability to extract data including (at various stages encryption march contacts photos calls imessages without unlocking phones that bit key previous cases apple complied legitimate government requests information method used
it has unlocked iphones  extracted data accessible locked process doing laid white paper law enforcement language

it worth noting government tools unlock phones without apple help  hit miss apple worth noting statements court new york case government says apple unlocks devices  bypasses lock extract information
the california case contrast involves device running ios  data previously accessible phone locked ceased  release ios  apple started securing encryption tied passcode hardware id device facetime instance has been encrypted  imessages 
so apple unable extract data including imessages device data encrypted is the reason fbi wants apple weaken security brute force passcode data  read unless passcode entered properly
if assume stories correct apple complied requests to unlock iphone passcodes before just refusing appear precedent set case fact apple fighting order hard  avoid precedent set

at the behest judge orenstein federal magistrate ny case apple filed response questioned new application awa apple argues reputation based security privacy complying court demands based expanded application  year old law it at risk tarnishing reputation apple waiting final order comply judge writs act used case california
still even apple comply new york  unlocking device merely extracting data standard methodology pre ios  devices fbi succeeds ordering apple comply california build new software version ios allowed electronic brute force password cracking important distinction make talking important precedent setting case
article updated clarify data apple extract
