debates economic value ultimately intertwined questions global economy function  raw figures attributed emerging technologies rarely accompanied big picture thinking frameworks principles guide economy
iot technological advancements reinforce existing paradigms simply making current make dispose linear economy more efficient whilst failing address resource natural capital issues
alternatively new connectivity offers opportunity think underlying support development a circular economy new technologies considered key enabler transition circular economy defined restorative regenerative design aiming products components materials highest utility value times
identified significant business opportunity circular economy models gained increasing momentum years combine principles regenerative restorative economy utilization useful life assets extended iot technologies provide information condition location availability assets  greater opportunity scale new models effectively providing new direction digital revolution
to pose example average european car currently spends  percent time parked large  automotive manufacturers including likes gm ford identified economic advantages  gained leasing vehicles car sharing models restricting time sales model
to bring models successfully scale manufacturers require ability carefully monitor condition vehicle iot sensors help improve maintenance lifespan existing cars provide wealth new data inform design durable effective products future
developing individual business models thing  recent report intelligent assets unlocking circular economy potential goes step looking opportunities larger vision built environment digital library materials sourced connected buildings provide information allows predictive maintenance effective sharing utilization space energy consumption sketched report multiplier impact terms benefit resolving number challenges single systemic solution assumed  significant
a similar approach  taken relation range sectors contrast today energy reliant centralized generation power burning fossil fuels large players possibility future connectivity enabled distributed grid free energy supply hundreds local solar wind energy generators supply power locally technology required particularly futuristic startups like vandebron netherlands brooklyn based transactive grid working way small scale
few attempts quantify scale economic value savings implementing wider systems nicolas cary founder blockchain has presented interesting perspective arguing digital payment  critical element future economy
