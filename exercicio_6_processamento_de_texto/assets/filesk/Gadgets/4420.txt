a developer colleague recently went on google photos knew background computational neuroscience thought i  interested google doing deep learning night i moved all my iphone photos external hardware magical cloud forgot week like tired boston subway passenger i checked phone religiously opened app images wife kids friends separate photo clusters 
well google later day i brought certain wine i liked conversation  remember i did photo label typed wine google photos app search shits giggles course photo wine  moment i began realize just powerful google technology becoming
the jaded say classified items pictures big deal jaded friend big deal figure ground segregation ability discriminate object foreground computer vision researchers working decades
today throw massive amounts images deep learning algorithm fairly accurately pick cow field grazing thing deep learning actually backpropagation (with recently added tricks machine learning godfather geoffrey hinton days cabbage patch kids bruce willis singing r&b
now combination massive compute power obscene amounts data thanks tech titans like google amazon deep learning algorithms getting better causing likes elon musk stephen hawking speak future possible dangers artificial intelligence
a words warranted caution intelligent minds translated skynet coming!!! general press blame just movie robots artificial intelligence involves sort dystopian future requiring schwarzeneggerian brute force overcome future overlords
despite called neural networks deep learning current form close biological brains process information yes vaguely speaking process input (touch taste smell multiply weight (a synapse brain send output (move hand  similarity ends
remember figure ground example brain does require knowledge existing priors solve problem infants born twice number neurons required figure important world regarding vision babies wire wee brains learning basic things like line orientation depth perception motion use subtle eye movements called saccades assess happening scene combining learned regarding shapes depth know coffee cup ends table begins
companies like neurala brain corp foregoing typical flavors deep learning build adaptive biological models helping robots learn environment words camera lens act eye sending signals aws replicating human retina thalamus primary visual cortex middle temporal inferior temporal cortex higher level understanding cup table
biologically inspired neural models require massively parallel computation understanding cortical subcortical region work elicit consciousness cause concern really come tech giants discover limitations current deep learning models turn neuroscientists coding functions like detecting wife face driving potholes feeling empathy lost loved one
this things interesting multisensory integration cognitive control neural synchrony combine rise new  qualitative experiences (or qualia non biological systems embodied machines learn experiences physical world internet things (iot precursor right iot devices dumb telemetry devices connected internet machines  people starting apply neural models sensor data
what learn processing sensors iot products soon carry robots touch vestibular heat vision sensors just like humans robots bio inspired brains make mistakes like motor babbling constantly updating information sensors learn higher higher depths association world them
there famous philosophy mind thought experiment called mary room scientist named mary stuck entire life black white room  read know color theory day mary allowed leave room sees bright red apple read color red prepare conscious experience redness moment robots experience redness like mary did just vapid linear number crunching
i believe way robots  truly conscious experience redness   embodied simulations wo physical electrical synchrony different brain regions working time elicits oh glob moment novel pleasurable stimulus experience interested details physical dependencies robot consciousness check post here
so living conscious robots crazy does mixed society reasoning empathetic non biological machines human beings look like finally getting topic hand  happens robot wants join church synagogue temple despite critics religion nefarious byproduct human evolution majority scholars believe religion serves evolutionarily advantageous purposes
for example jewish tradition numerous food body restrictions centered topic cleanliness avoiding unclean eating habits act circumcision likely increased jewish population natural selection fitness time hand sanitizer course social group dynamic benefits say able replicate human brain function synthetic brain good chance like religious spiritual sentiments arise robots
as practicing christian possibility gives bit chills judeo christian history humans told built image god  imago dei    robot tells spiritual experience worshipping church service sunday did really truly conscious experience soul separate conscious life robots conscious does mean souls different i hope making atheists believers alike squirm
i idea difference soul consciousness  gets heart humans piece physically lives die higher dimensions house soul send insights consciousness dimensional world get
as better worse holds faith larger i truly want believe way likely going  time address scenarios machines adapt  like us
amen
