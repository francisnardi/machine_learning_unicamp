when apple shot iphone  ad campaign covered billboards posters  cities world proved things quality mobile camera technology astronomical and mobile device manufacturers badly want know it
moves like smart world  billion digital photos shared daily basis  startling increase image quality result megapixel wars gone point noticeable consumers built  megapixel camera plenty non professional uses stopped better
at confined flat images smartphone cameras provide today  intel new realsense/project tango phone concept shows valuable data  captured depth small inexpensive sensors world dimensions consumer applications megapixels achieve
exploiting depth logical choice mobile device manufacturers products competitive i’m thinks so
intel party apple recently confirmed acquiring d sensor manufacturer linx  million did say  hard figure allied market research predicts  percent smartphones carry d sensors  earning total  billion  depth computer understand size shape distance objects field view means way use cases possible flat images  pair d glasses
the simplest examples image video editing image depth information allow change things like focus lighting taken apps far add remove entire objects scene lighting shading occlusion properly accounted depth bring eye catching special effects everybody way high resolution smartphone cameras photographer
and just start sized d sensors used d scanning process maps exact size shape colors given object  human face priceless works art idf keynote intel ceo brian krzanich quickly calculating storage space needed objects scanning d sensor
other popular uses  virtual augmented reality depth capture real environment (like apartment sale teleconferencing room let  world come virtual visit scan faces stick d avatar use teleconferencing video games applications exist d printing design mapping object recognition facial recognition gesture based control more
intel realsense like microsoft famous kinect cameras work projecting signal (a laser infrared light measuring bounces interacts environment work indoor situations benefit existing base software designed technique high consumer awareness makes attractive choice vendors
another technique stereovision method used apple new company linx based human depth perception kind sensor takes feeds cameras (eyes compares difference horizontal placement object calculate far away stereovision subject interference way active depth sensing techniques meaning potential greater viability outdoors longer ranges
two big challenges kept stereovision limelight comparing feeds real time takes lots computing power calibrating multiple cameras gets complicated recent advances mobile chipsets beginning remedy issues expect realsense style linx style solutions market near future
memories memorable attempts d smartphones years ago stir doubts trend  d tech days primitive hope bring hollywood style d new platform movies consumer facing application capturing depth success technology improved raw performance  validated far use cases
more importantly consumer d hot facebook google microsoft pouring billions vr/ar research acquisitions dominate headlines new build real time environment maps provided depth sensors used test self driving taxis autonomous delivery drones total registered mobile developers growing hundreds thousands year sure loads apps make use d sensors ways experts ca predict
so selfie generation mobile devices best smile picture  worth thousand words
