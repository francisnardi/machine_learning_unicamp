there question iot ushering new era innovation connecting digital machine worlds bring greater speed efficiency diverse sectors including automotive aviation energy healthcare  sensitive data increasingly accessible online  endpoints open attackers  businesses quickly realizing security  afterthought
the bad news relying solutions failed past  which continue fail created decades ago secure communications human parties public key infrastructure (pki designed handle complexity managing  billion devices industrial scale networks
mckinsey estimates cost ineffective cybersecurity rise  trillion  given number connected devices predicted reach  billion  urgent need fundamentally rethink security  connected high volume decentralized world machines
bruce schneier observed s focused data motion  communication parties  focused data rest emphasis major reason modern security continues fail need consider data entire lifetime just secure transmission devices  meaningless device compromised

the underlying assumption today machines sensor data manage  secured  exactly securing information security components
the overwhelming majority modern security solutions  encryption firewalls factor authentication tokens  target data confidentiality erecting barriers unauthorized access  machines communications protocols software rules exposed apis  vulnerabilities
what happens weak points breached confidentiality compromised cases like sony anthem breach detected months later administrators must identify pieces data accessed and/or manipulated  economically socially costly task
unfortunately i think security expert world thinks build iot networks vulnerabilities need new approach breaches detected need know data changed how
this integrity issue   key focus modern security age connected focusing integrity require different approach new set tools data integrity schemes based blockchain merkle hash trees scalable provable data possession (spdp dynamic provable data possession (dpdp good places industry focus efforts

we work scaling technologies making reliable large networks necessary complement endpoint security especially iot industry schneier points relation integrity attacks we’ve tried retrofit security fact warns attacks start doing real damage  dies hacked car medical device entire city  services day   real outcry something
the reality basing integrity networks systems security key stores administrators manage failing strategy truly effective solutions continuously monitor state network entry points data energy resources spent guarding breaches let devote equal attention protocols  if  occur
