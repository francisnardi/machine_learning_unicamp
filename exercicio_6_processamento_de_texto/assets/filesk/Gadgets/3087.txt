this week ces kymeta announced partnership panasonic bring lightweight flat panel antennas maritime market kymeta core technology mtenna designed communicate satellites order bring high speed internet to move
the partnership allow kymeta leverage panasonic satellite network current maritime customer base includes owners yachts merchant vessels cruise ships vessels panasonic agreed order significant volume mtennas manufacture distribute vessels world
the mtenna replace larger complex antenna options maritime market
traditionally antenna vessel requires weeks downtime install current technology requires moving parts means noisier antenna wear tear unique innovations mtenna ability use software electronically acquire signals moving parts
however mtenna ready commercial use just work required perfect new technology prove capabilities prototype testing antenna terminal specifically maritime use begin year  commercially available 
the partnership comes shortly kymeta revealed successful results mobility test analyzed functionality mtenna roof car course  miles test proved mtenna capable communicating ku band satellites previously antenna just tested ka band satellites
this distinction important satellite operators (potential kymeta partners work types satellites operate band other
panasonic example uses global ku band satellite network provide internet television mobile phone services planes ships remote locations
panasonic customer intelsat operator world largest satellite fleet means panasonic satellite fleet kymeta  using operated intelsat kymeta partnered february  håkan olsson vp maritime kymeta told techcrunch reason new panasonic partnership harmonizes nicely current partnership intelsat develop ku band antennas maritime
what interesting partnership panasonic offers ku band antenna (albeit airplanes communicate satellite network exconnect antenna currently used provide internet united airplanes thicker larger kymeta mtenna
the exconnect technology inherently different uses motors steer antenna catch satellite signal mtenna uses software electronically communicate satellites smaller lighter frame moving parts mtenna large improvement panasonic existing options
if example kymeta partnered company provide internet maritime market panasonic able compete mtenna patented technology
in addition maritime vessels kymeta technology bring internet planes cars kymeta told techcrunch key partnership related automobile market  announced week certainly lot promise associated mtenna
to deliver promises kymeta need strategic partnerships satellite operators various manufacturers addition proving technology date partnership panasonic kymeta significant step achieving goals bringing mtenna market
