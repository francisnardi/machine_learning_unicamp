andy rubin creator android  arguably widest distributed operating world  left google years start hardware incubator  million fund called playground
since pretty busy trying envision future hardware does just include robotics bloomberg technology conference showed pieces hardware transponder drones backpack basically provides haptic feedback alongside music represent kind new novel way real world interact internet data  rubin thinks big bets technology happen
i think new opportunity bring data offline sources cloud rubin said bloomberg technology conference robotics comes robots are walking mobile sensors sense environment interact learn interactions computer science we sense plan act the act historical perspective doing stuff cloud trapped cloud ca interact real world stuck jar robotics act sense plan send real world
at playground rubin te  bench  engineers experts fields like computer science mechanical engineering  incubating  companies rubin said way works companies basically envisioning new ways computing interact real world come given resources  financing  figure head real world
the applications rubin te working necessarily hardware rubin mentioned incubating quantum computing company  play rethinking underlying architecture computing figure ai applications new level  using standard manufacturing processes said
when opportunity comes like aligning the stars rubin said perfectly aligned boom start it
speaking quantum computing spent lot time talking ai  new foundational layer internet said  worried ai turning taking world ability high level pattern matching extremely efficient level ai good  good apply expertise domain domains said
what ai good pattern matching quantum computing good rubin said things combined hundreds years point conundrum master and who servant think just quantum computing ai type architecture eliminate known forms encryption different problems worry skynet coming online worry does mean compute magnitude quantum computing
rubin playground just making bets inbound companies said plenty opportunities hatch new companies company using resources engineers  founder android  said quite smartphone space
remember thing really keeps going gets awake new product created people use rubin said thing playground does bench engineers lot capital invest act traditional venture capital firm wait people come door like quantum computing company say yes we’ll invest we’ll pattern matching we’ll notice not walking door notion hatching companies playground using resources bench of engineers funding setting free i actively hatched mobile space
