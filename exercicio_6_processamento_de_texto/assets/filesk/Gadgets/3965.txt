it violate laws physics  dangerous  impossible critics concluded despite actually knowing details u wireless power technology let rumors swirl today u revealed bunch details far fast just plain charge phone wires
people saying investing  million u wrong silicon valley u founder ceo meredith perry tells referencing startup big investors include andreessen horowitz founders fund upfront ventures marissa mayer mark cuban
  apps social photo sharing stuff perry contends building real building insanely difficult difficult people think frauds
skepticism important comes hard science startups theranos example little benefit doubt i’m skeptical u  i eyes  potential innovation important wireless power deserves  approached open mind
when skepticism based purely vague assumptions leads premature conclusions  blind cynicism

for overview u ultrasound wireless power read deep dive  essentially transmitters room walls track devices u receivers send inaudibly high pitched ultrasound beams receiver converts vibrations sound electricity charges connected device
since ultrasound right frequency intensity safe use humans animals  requires line sight ca charge walls clothes u power wireless phone chargers  light bulbs appliances more
now facts ubeam that people asked years   published now
the information focused beams frequency decibel level dispels rumors u inefficient unsafe claims significant power loss distance potential cause burns ultrasound sickness based assumptions u radiate sound lower frequencies higher decibel levels
still people ca look info conclude u plausible i spoke experts space reviewed details thoughts
dr matt o’donnell phd is one world leading experts ultrasonics professor dean emeritus engineering university of washington writes
while ca vouch technology does work concludes given specs infeasible just  tough execute
dr babur hadimioglu phd electrical engineering stanford similar perspective principle scientist labcyte the technical advisory board ultrasonic device company microsonic systems believes u impossible  told wo vouch real sees writes
essentially stopping u ability make efficient release commercially viable product

there huge limitations hurdles though
first u ca charge walls people clothes bags wo  getting juiced just having phone pocket  table hand means u end better keeping devices charged use charging later
u refused reveal retail cost of devices making affordable users partners  essential compete magnetic resonance based wireless power company witricity radio wave based energous racing release consumer product u ca just work work affordable price
 we’ll look pretty soon u promises showing demos people outside te investors partners year we’ll facts paper add power hands
