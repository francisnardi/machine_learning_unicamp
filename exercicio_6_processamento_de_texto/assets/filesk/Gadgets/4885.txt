are robots going work that  question every click bait economic article mind
the short answer not
the long answer change kinds jobs just like stone tools printing press factories computers changed work thinking changes going happen organizations embrace changes critical success
societies individuals adapting new tools long we’ve using we’ve adapted water wheel ste engine automobile assembly line telegraph television  we’ll adapt robot initially tools confined experts artisans specialists  the commercially viable socially useful tools stay long economic incentive  getting productive tools hands possible
a classic example is computer software industry early programming languages difficult learn  subsequent versions  easier we’ve progressed packaged user friendly business applications solutions advanced business user need know software code
robots however are new tools horizon field reason (being useful productive tool  developing growing faster robotics  analytics
why analytics  progressively coming represent human processes data digitizing economy society analytics tool employ understand data extension tool best data productive use
in fact analytics tool needed figure use robot cost effective use robot robot telling process doing just robots key productivity lies designers  users analytics analytics tool for understanding data world  programming coding  understanding world
here examples analytics game changing way robots
early analytics required stat degree sort visualization gives business user opportunity just look results  analysis a medication management company nursing staff helps reduce medical costs  patient visual dashboard allows monitor overall medication utilization trends  chronically ill service drill individual level immediately contact physicians issues arise
this information available past   staff needed make requests reports likely date time arrived they’ve got analytical capabilities fingertips
it purely analytics  requires analytical bent corral data use collaboratively example financial models built bankers manage risk models  complex hand built excel spreadsheets model mania proliferated  harder track catalog models used different departments
an analytics library concept called model management evolved allow banks safely quickly efficiently catalog analyze models use  retiring potentially dangerous ones helping departments select models successfully deployed global financial company  staff members accessing interactive library cataloged  documents  linkages related development validation deployment monitoring models managers need  modeling experts use management system
