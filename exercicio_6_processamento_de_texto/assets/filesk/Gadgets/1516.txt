when really need signal pluto direct connection  possible oh sure big project like new horizons make sure line clear listening   routine updates neptune orbiter power starved comet lander delay/disruption tolerant networking just got big installation international space station
what dtn glad asked protocol suite  resilient face huge interruptions connectivity  example entire planet star passes nodes network big problem today  eventually  more probes satellites orbiters begin crowd big empty

a dtn powered network uses store forward technique breaks communications chunks  transferred independent reassembled theyâ€™ve arrived going bit like bittorrent gets pieces compared traditional downloads start beginning end end
it useful tool situations connectivity unreliable myriad reasons occur space radiation power failure obstruction lander gets  minutes sun day send data packages piecemeal instead waiting batteries charge stay online hours send thing

the iss recently added dtn telescience resource kit making satellite piece nasa says eventually form solar scale internet
dtn little star power nasa collaborated vint cerf optimistic possibilities protocol suite

yes internet things reached boundaries small planet large solar system
dtn major collaboration  organizations implementations  available open source code read scroll nasa post contributors listed
