let say certain list really biohacking let assume ok having discoid roaches house let assume mind people operating roaches dining room table i got christmas gift idea you!
we talked roboroach  idea  weird repellent arguably idea weird repellent  incredible experiment neuroscience great way teach stem potentially bored kids
what roboroach  kit includes small bluetooth powered chip mini surgery roaches cost extra  local pet store recommend discoid roaches fly helpful markers bodies help surgery

to install insert tiny wire lead roach wing muscle snip connect leads roach antennae step glue lead head carapace process precise imprecise born surgeon sure mess things  bug essentially asleep ministrations thanks ice water bath occurs step squeamish insertion leads quite difficult time snipping antennae insertion leads quite scary held super glue low temperature hot glue gun insect survive procedure live happy life experiment dying natural death albeit pronged lead attached head
once installed simply connect small light electrical stimulator bug start sending signals
how does work treat like scientific experiment actually remote control roach like signal generator sends electrical pulses roach antennae pulses send roach moving left right depending signal works brief period neuroplasticity kicks roach forgets signals
i did kids ages    weirded  good time watching talking experiment unlike say model rocketry project quite involved quite advanced i definitely solid experiments coming kit inspire biologists future
the roboroach make perfect sense gift holiday list make sense want roaches tree judgement make  rest assured crazy crazy fun way learn biohacking real way
