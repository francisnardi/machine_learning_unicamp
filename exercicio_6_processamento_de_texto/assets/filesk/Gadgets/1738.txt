the vibraphone research comes romit roy choudhury nirup roy associate professor phd candidate respectively electrical computer engineering school university illinois ubana champaign
it surprisingly simple idea really a vibration motor really like tiny speaker speaker  microphone think it
okay obvious  magnetic surface position controlled applied voltage  arranged position changes voltage instead way speaker way microphone
so fundamentally surprising vibration motor  used pick sounds wrote paper (pdf  presented later month mobisys singapore  fidelity possible somewhat unexpected
first  clear attack ca  executed air motor  physically rewired  simple job  minute invasive technique conceivable  possible exploit power controller chip collect voltage fluctuation vibration motor roy wrote email techcrunch did investigate possibility
furthermore linear resonant actuator (lra vibration motors tested  cheaper older devices use eccentric rotating mass (erm motors spin weight create vibrating motion  susceptible attack roy wrote
at rate reconfiguration vibration motor begins turning vibrations encounters voltage variations roy choudhury showed  reconstructed waveforms

of course microphones tend make bad speakers vice versa  say device meant buzz doug roberts precision microdrives makes lra motors  things wrote say impressive researchers able pick speech despite lras superficial resemblance speakers really quite unsuitable task having high q factors (checks  i check wikipedia
the limitations rigging tiny thing mic appear instantly frequencies captured low end spectrum petering  khz comparison original spectrograms recovered ones allowed researchers create process guessing higher frequencies  present result is… great
 recording album degraded state sounds  recognized humans voice recognition algorithms decent accuracy people got  percent time naive voice rec  percent just proof concept  come vastly improve performance

is going sneak house steal phone quietly disassemble rewire listen garbled audio asking siri recipes  attack vector devices like fitness bands smartwatches lack microphones vibration motors enticing targets thinks carefully monitor say step tracker
in meantime researchers going deeper intrusive direction instead i applaud looking constructive applications
we exploring similar techniques help recover speech subtle vibration vocal cords facial bones skull roy wrote possible  useful develop assistive persons speech impairment
i look forward research topic read listen voice samples vibraphone site
