fabricating circuit board tough  takes forth bugs shipping costs turn small project big problem botfactory raised  million stick pcb printer desk
founded nyu grad students nicolas vansnick carlos ospina nyu professor michael knox botfactory came vansnick ospina needed make pcb class project nearly student class failed circuit boards time iteration took weeks complete
this lesson tremendous  problem typical project solution revolutionize electronics  prototyped fabricated said vansnick everybody trying miniaturize electronics chips  processes employed create pcbs
their product squink took theyâ€™ve shipped  machines track ship dozen squink obviously niche product  need pick place machines office   great start fascinating project kit uses conductive ink solder place components right circuit board
they raised  million ny angels lead investor
ultimately goal provide desktop machine allow make board relatively low cost said vansnick
traditionally pcb manufacture consisted sending schematic fabricator asia waiting board single chip  sent bugs weeks fix weeks ship moving entire process piece hardware office lads botfactory fixed massive time sink
the basic squink costs  advanced versions cost  quite real maker pricing  han solo said spock away weapon bots seek making pcbs home!
