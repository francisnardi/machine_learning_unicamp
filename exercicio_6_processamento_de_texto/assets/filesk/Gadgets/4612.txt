original participants world famous(tm hardware battlefield folks cubesensors new devices promise make lives bit better original cubesensors little boxes containing environmental sensors let know nasty stuff air  particulate matter like  systems measuring temperature humidity new devices sold koto called blink air storm
the blink small basic sensor tells room hot loud bright think line defense bad times air includes environmental sensors including systems control humidity temperature particulate matter finally storm sort hub includes storm sensors

why need koto devices home health monitors allow check problems remotely hide background use example air sensor let know happening baby lights marlboro crib light candle playing super smash brothers help pinpoint problems having sleeping breathing simply existing
the company launched indiegogo campaign selling set  buy individual pieces separately looking raise   hitting shortly
while true use case  discovered things  nice  integral lives  i suspect networks grow weâ€™ll far interesting data coming i welcome robotic environmental sensing overlords
