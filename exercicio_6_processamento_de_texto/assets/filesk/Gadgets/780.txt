a master thesis cmusimon kalouche posits new form robotic leg designed maximum range motion importantly easily control method force reduction words kind leg want robot send mars
goat stands gearless omni directional acceleration vectoring topology uses single motor planetary gear create highly dynamic range motion goat allows leg dynamically  splats hard entire leg brunt fall needs sideways sheer cliff face like goat modify legs accordingly i think best way think leg expanding contracting plastic balls various vertices buy science museums  shrink grown handle sorts positioning problems real time
