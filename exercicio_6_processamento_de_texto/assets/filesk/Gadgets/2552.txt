the internet things internet inextricably linked  increasingly questions centered iot devices work  and happens internet connection goes down
users concerned privacy implications having data stored corporation servers like having internet connection potential point failure these reactions rational  reminiscent online shopping circa  ironically  secure shopping physical retail stores
to understand device makers relying internet connection cloud services need look iot devices work need understand data sources processing device device communication ultimately device leverage device
as maker climate control devices critical sources data humans environment (indoor energy utilities
there humans desire  comfortable boils having certain air temperature radiant temperature humidity  things humans live variety geographies meaning large differences like inside actual outdoor conditions imparting comfort space large indoor/outdoor difference takes energy energy subject supply demand forces using intelligently means understanding price given time
let distill concrete data sources phones arguably today ultimate wearable source data including location macro level (at home away micro level (in particular room advanced systems like provide information human input accelerometer movement cases microphone
sensors provide environmental data (indoor outdoor raw physical conditions often because cost power constraints little processing onboard case temperature humidity ambient light digital view going space external sources data like electricity gas rates utilities weather conditions observed parties
already cases home operate ideally offsite data sources phones reporting location run groceries weather yahoo utility rates pg&e instance raw data leads question  sent  used
all data needs place go  host server farm home probably want invest  economies scale dictate amazon  better configuring router accept data pushes stuff consumer tech nightmares  scalable cloud redundantly backed amazon better virtually practically home
 processing needs physical gps location understand relates home location translate long you left now it needs combine information long takes make apartment comfortable different weather conditions adjust set point accordingly
this logic complex gets complicated add data sources sensors context (time day sunlight host server home processes  a server must exist iot device needs host apps device home one argue precisely smart hubs (or  numerous hubs cropped practical device maker build app hub just consume data external data sources
effectively storage space smart hub  compared infinitely scalable database cloud service want processing close proximity data avoid wasteful data transport sure need temperature data second  think data coming dropc processing needed turn video stre actionable notifications triggers automation
and devices talk does really make sense device wi fi chip gateway devices route  connected gateway based growing number standards varying power range data rate requirements evident there likely going  sort iot topological convergence cases device simply needs report proximity phone (think beacons device operating challenging rf environment struggles higher frequency radios used thread zigbee ideal technical selection
in cases gateway variety sensors makes total sense  unless gateway overwhelming market penetration support wide variety protocols hard sell device manufacturer place bet choose sides buy  wi fi chips produce gateway  dollars
so does mean does flick light switch need to cloud come turn light bulb of course means manufacturers continue preference http integrations instead offering intranet things solutions means sane fallbacks behaviors needed internet connection interrupted
internet companies need meet  nines support levels means case second internet connection home (like businesses have it means internet things exist sans internet
