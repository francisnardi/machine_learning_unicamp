what  cooler like bosphorus mechatronics little box lets connect including wireless connections rotary input board  programmed windows linux called tinylab tinkerers dre  i/o storage options arduino support  
tinylab especially lazy ones like mess cables shields soldering tinylab just coding! totally compatible arduino platform defaults libraries work it popular things like displays buttons relay sensors sockets modules popular iot ecosystem said founder ahmet sait borlak include xbee bluetooth wireless support
an early bird kit costs  ship may
the te consists number skilled hardware hackers makers founded called makerhane istanbul created shop maker space workshops created tinylab realized lot fun build standard board use over connect arduino bunch io connectors

arduino hero design realized use common components generally time need make circuits display send sense said borlak using breadboard turns torture using stackable shields does serve purpose generally need shields  ca stack pin overlaps think tinylab  painkiller designed used love decided share perfect education compatible mit scratch think place school laboratories
it fun little project quite geeky like udoo allows far interesting projects  built soldering fussing shields connectors makes prototyping easier dare say fun
