one days going aircraft electric just cars   meantime ca slack comes research make possible nasa announced research projects help make planes efficient green
it organization transformative aeronautics concepts progr dozens internal projects aimed improving (as suggests transforming aviation picked series pitches tacp te startup battlefield style (or close  awarded  years funding  million year
the thing preventing electric aircraft taking speak boils lack energy best batteries ca store nearly power equivalent volume jet fuel make better use energy store making aircraft lighter propulsion efficient  ultimately batteries need better

replacing battery fuel cell option project looking possibility super efficient cell combine oxygen air hydrogen jet fuel produce electricity use exhaust drive turbine  using fossil fuels   extracting energy doing cleaner way
the electric engine driven energy  efficient d printing  solution improved additive manufacturing techniques enable smaller power dense motors  make lighter
another way save weight lose body plane vertical tail fin used center plane  adds drag nasa looking possibility using adjustable winglets serve stabilizers landing  flatten better aerodynamics flight reduce need large tail fin plane  lighter present lower profile
the project quite green  interesting unmanned aerial vehicles currently need  operated radio line sight satellite tracking  better  antennas required bulky researchers investigating possibility aerogel based antenna conforms closely contours aircraft enables transmission receiving multiple directions
nasa does expect projects bear fruit  failure option depends definition failure said tacp manager doug rohn news release really point make things described  determine realistically  answer   now
