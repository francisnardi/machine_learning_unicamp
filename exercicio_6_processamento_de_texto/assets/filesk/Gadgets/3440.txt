in spike jonze her joaquin phoenix falls love earpiece  female voice inside film depicts society artificially intelligent hearing devices serve human companions
a cliché hearables future her nonetheless raises key issues regarding increasingly saturated industry of ear worn wearables  resolved  prevent isolated world people  increasingly obsessed trinkets  herald advancement hearable technologies  capable self reflection introspection
the lonely future portrayed in her is exactly hearable technology evolve reinforces people generally perceive earpieces  isolating potentially embarrassing we’ve seen (and joked early iterations bluetooth headset  clunky protruding device gave comical impression talking oneself attempted standardize hearable technology effort combat existing stigma isolation introversion exuded headphones earphones
bluetooth headsets introduced world potential hearables  stigma especially present health devices hearing aids impression user immersed world perceived socially awkward
yet instead merely combatting the existing stigma hearables companies aim to reshape it making devices visible step right direction  challenge make normative facilitate transition ai companions need  socially accepted
according maurizio cibelli co founder ceo italy based hutoma startup developing technology create emotionally intelligent neural network systems similar of her biggest challenges lot discussion ai people perceptions immediately turn negative hear term  difficult thing measure moment
one solution transform earpieces social experience instead tuning environment develop hearables tune world them
products like doppler labs here and motorola hint aim curate live experiences enhancing sounds people want hear  isolating reducing unwanted noises train sounds airplane turbulence features amazing transformative
in a previous interview with techcrunch doppler labs founder ceo noah kraft says envisages world audio experience perfect
it just making technology outstanding people feel comfortable going public wearing devices wear proudly hide makes feel socially stigmatized says kraft
with wristbands fitness trackers discuss concept stickiness lack thereof users buy products stop using months a survey conducted endeavour partners found  percent consumers stop using device months
one goal companies develop product service  used consumers day long possible certain devices iphone ipad reached widespread adoptability usability cater demographic groups accessible easy use similarly hearables devices  intuitive easy learn unobtrusive lifestyle possible lest technology  temporary fad
according dr steven leboeuf founder president of valencell raleigh based company develops biometric sensors hearables important thing consider
what people care improve lives says leboeuf way mobile phones clear way fitness trackers hearables quite clear needs  ways integrate experiences people living people really want know uniquely  uniquely happening improve lifestyles
to better understand public perceptions companies developing hearable technology seeking cater niche markets  enthusiasts will  phasing mass market
our product apply beginning niche targeting tech enthusiasts perfect point want grow organically says cibelli actually works pretty target people first
noah kraft agrees ideal customer start customer deeply passionate music they’ve contacted  waitlist  beta progr  world really feedback like not… niche demographic  passionate one
the potential sector limitless years  wireless earbuds facilitate real time language translation use sensors integrate biometric data influence gaming companies like elbee and valencell trying tackle problems focus using ear interact applications elbee example users tell wireless earbuds turn lights control temperature send text messages  addition playing music
yet technicalities need  developed depending uses hearable
smaller smarter sensors 
earbuds intend measure vitals blood flow calories burned pulse prioritize accuracy sensors challenge incorporate sensors validated rigorously tested  small fit comfortably ear
the ear comparatively advantageous wrist relatively stationary means lot easier measure vitals effectively ear unique shape unlike wrist small environment filled moisture earwax developers account factors optimizing devices
there need make sensors smarter making ‘true wireless earbuds real estate devices … start running space says leboeuf people want add more sensor functionality sensors starting  big things to ways improving reducing size adding functionality sensors
in addition accuracy sensors need  smart
assessments need  based real accurate data says leboeuf does earpiece know accurate getting data know things valencell developed way know right measurements right model
battery life
current recreational wireless earbuds average   hours continuous usage hearing aids as eargo are able entire day charge
minimizing processes conserve battery life tenant  longer battery life major determinant people wear hearable ideally device long smartphone withstanding constant usage obstacle issue wearables especially important hearables transform simply commodity necessity portable battery chargers plus
choosing right wireless technology
many wireless earbuds use bluetooth  companies attempting utilize wireless technologies music streaming hearnotes example using kleer alternative bluetooth developed microchip technology according hearnotes kleer optimized deliver lossless high quality wireless audio portable audio devices consume power resulting x battery life comparable bluetooth devices
the analysis draws comparing current  milliwatt bluetooth headsets  milliwatt consumption kleer devices discrepancy increased kleer ability carry  x data rate
one challenge prototypes providing clear communication left right earbuds device according elbee founder ceo konrad holubek positioning antenna earbuds crucial ensure hearables device operates seamlessly
the future spike jonze film envisioned actually distant companies developing deep learning neural networks transform digital assistant merely taking commands virtual companion help learn grow  ai capable thought
indeed hutoma project (inspired film course developing technology just aim develop neural network provide basic intelligence potential users build and customize
according cibelli technologies like potential hearables i hope hearables adopt ai i think pretty needed says cibelli benefits applications
hearables companies currently developing products aim supplement augment hearing products come variations (in ear ear ear companies shared goal engaging expanding ear advantages different ideas so
as result comes user experience hearables provide
it easy individual technologies taking doing cool stuff interesting connect dots  lot validation  says leboeuf testing technology people time
