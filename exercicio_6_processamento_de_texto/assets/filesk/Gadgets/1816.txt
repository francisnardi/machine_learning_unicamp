there plenty premature obituaries privacy falling from lips tech company ceos recent years idea people sub set of personal information they wish keep outside public sphere persists  despite incentives encouragements proverbial user to be as naked  comes sticking their data online
even kingpin privacy slayer facebook mark zuckerberg kept birth daughter max quiet several days november  publishing + word open letter december  mark moment publicly  famously bought multiple properties palo alto home affording family luxury large private domestic space prying neighbors peering fence privacy dead hardly
the latest confirmation privacy remains stubbornly lodged human psyche comes new study published today pew research center probes americans attitudes privacy across a range different theoretical scenarios  advantageous trade suggested in exchange for handing personal data
the internet adage ‘if free product’ applies degrees pew researchers sketched out a range different scenarios to survey participants test risk benefit calculations attitudes sharing  unsurprisingly  spectrum of responses result
a phrase summarizes attitudes ‘it depends writes report author lee rainie director internet science technology research pew research center likely consider options case case basis apply hard fast privacy rules
the key takeaway here privacy a deeply personal issue person ‘happy share’  personal tmi red line zuck clearly comfortable telling the world what his new year challenge every january via a public facebook post evidently happy letting anyone see going living room
point ca divorce privacy individual people different  single answer to how much privacy people happy to trade away use particular product/service frankly pew able synthesis hard fast privacy rules far surprising
the six ‘privacy probing’ scenarios pew detailed research participants were an employer installing surveillance cameras facial recognition technology spate workplace thefts footage set  retained indefinitely potentially used track employee attendance performance measures doctor office using health information website manage patient records make easier schedule appointments agree upload health data grocery store offering loyalty discounts exchange tracking purchases selling data parties auto insurance company offering discounts exchange monitoring driving speed and location access school reunion social media website exchange profiled site ad serving purposes connected thermostat that analyses domestic energy usage potentially save money  shares data domestic activity company gizmo
while research organization made sure not explicitly reference specific companies these scenarios easily transpose tech giants its examples  ad profiling social network facebook google owned learning thermostat maker nest obvious ones
participants study asked ‘bargain’ being offered return sharing their information acceptable acceptable whether it depends the context choice they were asked descri words what factors contributed making selection

what did pew noted lot variation with generally consistent demographic patterns emerging responses  based on age gender income level or criteria  interestingly rank scenarios acceptable acceptable turns to the  involving the nest style smart thermostat just  cent participants said scenario acceptable vs  cent saying  cent said depend circumstances
given zuckerberg fiercely protective display of privacy comes to his home really not surprising want talk privacy having focal point majority people point going to  home  personal private space ‘smart home’ technologies like nest entail the harvesting of home activity commercial entity make use data various unknown ways pose obvious threat sense peace people derive having place where shut world out
( nest specific case company stresses does share user data parent google/alphabet says gathers data required operate service read privacy policy here  does include provision share non personal information (eg aggregated anonymized customer data publicly partners adds steps non personal information associated require partners policies user data privacy rights potentially terminate company sold nest noting sale transfer company and/or assets personal information   items sold transferredwe request purchaser treat data privacy statement place time collection
and think notion employer deploying face detecting surveillance cameras that can tabs on staff attendance big brother style highly objectionable pew researchers fact majority ( cent respondents accepting scenario  workplace entails having signed a contract agreeing abide a third party rules words house rules
 comes person home house rules… example pew flags one survey respondent explanation rejecting trade potential energy savings exchange having domestic habits tracked emphatic declaration will  ‘smart’ anythings household i personal data stolen the government sold companies spammers now
so looks like smart home startups really need to  putting privacy center proposition want appeal widest possible user base
pew researchers recorded regular expressions anger barrage of unsolicited emails phone calls customized ads contacts inevitably arises they elect share information  instance study participants complaining lack relevant ads foisted eye line and wishing control the marketing content exposed to
another concern flagged research lack transparency companies doing harvested data point european politicians finally agreed new data protection rules at end year tighten region rules around data processing consent  requirement that companies doing business european union obtain unambiguous consent consumers use data gain consent wish use data a different purpose originally state some americans wish similar rules incoming…
on flip pew report flags obvious point people like free service  just  cent survey respondents identifying social media trade scenario acceptable (vs  cent saying you’d  forgiven thinking with that particular scenario pew notes was a considerable difference responses based age   cent age  saying deal acceptable vs just quarter ( cent aged  ok trade off
pew also suggests general dislike social media information people share platforms might  coloring respondents views ‘bargain’ presented  skewing responses negative particular scenario
that begs question cause this general dislike social media it not  associated technology privacy eroding habits pew report details comments gathered from participants willing accept trade  including plenty disgruntled views volume marketing content encountering sites days
eg
so  case ‘facebook fatigue’ creeping here
other comments suggest entire social media category victim facebook category dominating success  social media general inextricably linked to facebook making respondents little point using similar website (for example participant recorded saying i social media sites manage i’d use facebook privacy settings similar described fine  i want start using site
facebook success ubiquity social media space  said ‘poisoned well’ trying encourage similar public social sharing  unless offering distinctly different bounded form social sharing goes on mobile messaging apps example successful alternative social sharing model (so successful facebook shelled  billion buy the dominant player whatsapp 
pew asked participants views future privacy found that most of the focus group participants downbeat  believing the trend surveillance data capture is inexorable many also said believe younger americans sensitive personal privacy ( success youth friendly social messaging app snapchat suggest otherwise…
the pew study is based on a survey  adults online focus groups  participants research conducted january  february  year
