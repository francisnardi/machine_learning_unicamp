yes apple watch permission knew spent time bar monitored heartbeat physiological data saw changes indicating overdrinking
when walked car connected carkit powered entertainment understood situation disabled car start button used apple watch uber instead
or leaving work instead bar device connects car stereo based elevated stress level starts playing favorite relaxing jams
it possible
for time  able combine previously unattainable data change seamlessly interacting world (and measuring process
the apple watch digital physical physiological worlds begin intersect
how does happen
it starts location location data core modern mobile phone  combining gps recently ibeacon interactions passively collected data  holy grail mobile
until recently average consumer numerous sensors devices gps accelerometer sound measurement  smartphone hidden away pocket handbag available tilt wrist
these sensors combined user input geodata useful actionable likes yelp foursquare google maps fitbit exist slew companies working store solutions merge hyper local data commerce  things
how answer desired apple watch app feature based surveys month saw users want walk grocery store aisle shopping list sort dynamically simple interactions like just tip iceberg
 apple watch takes sensors step further
sensors measure individual physiological data augmenting complementing data
the apple watch monitor
unlike iphone  aspect apple watch means things  constantly monitored  percent correctly identified right owner
whereas iphone  hijacked kid gaming purposes buried deep pocket apple  watch  hand uniquely identified wearer
apple introduction new human sensors allows companies consumers explore entirely new area data
suddenly we’ll  able assess stressed group meeting nervous date
people using experiencing benefits apple watch augmented connected health monitoring tool
the apple watch heart monitor saved high school football player life detected early signs life threatening kidney problem
epiwatch researchkit app apple watch designed users epilepsy track seizures ultimately better understand condition app collects monitors data apple watch sensors manual input epileptic seizures
the apple watch (and iphone can interact iot devices cloud
the engage use apple watch trackable ways  analytically visualized richer potential insights  really going on
we know emotions states mind leave physiological traces apple watch measure  increased pulse slowed increased response times unsteadiness
by combining physiological data data user environment intelligence data increased wearables connected objects  like noise sound monitors thermometers pollution sensors sun exposure detectors etc  contribute analysis person current mental physical state device alert user abnormal behavior state mind
in near future new apple watch apps offer gentle reminders users slow break  based truly holistic understanding state being
these kinds possibilities benefit simply opens entirely new dimension innovation
in sense apple watch truly intimate personal device set change experience everyday life
