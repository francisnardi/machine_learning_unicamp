putting body cameras police like net good involved  deploy subtler effects  questions  better answered sooner later new large scale study shows risk making things worse  body cameras actually increase incidents violence
part problem important note outset lot data  data organized collected coherent way
at present worldwide uncontrolled social experiment taking place  underpinned feverish public debate billions dollars government expenditure researchers write paper robust evidence just keeping pace adoption new technology
the study researchers cambridge rand europe controlled tracked camera use  officers  departments uk  totaling  million work hours
on average assaults officers increased  percent wearing cameras sites showed effect  said data inadequate dive general reason increase equally unclear authors warn drawing conclusions clearly supported data

however imagine officer stuck script chose activate camera using discretion middle interaction shifts case use force actually increased  percent average
in case researchers propose likely reason officer decides announce mid interaction beginning film example provoke reaction results use force principal investigator barak ariel said press release

perhaps pressing increase assaults officers finding weak subject numerous caveats  used argument deploying body cameras blame commissioner opting progr arguably puts people risk
