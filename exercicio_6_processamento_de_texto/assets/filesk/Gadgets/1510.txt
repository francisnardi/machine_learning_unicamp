the internet things genie bottle growing accelerating pace according gartner  billion connected things  use worldwide   percent  number soar than  billion 
others present higher estimates
the opportunities improved utility energy saving efficiency safety lying data gathered immense numbers connected sensors smart devices huge precedent
however challenges come chaotic growth iot new cases unfamiliar knowing anticipating slow process  halt altogether
here changes we’ll face iot  ingrained lives  tech community getting prepared deal them
identifying devices network key securing iot ecosystems preventing infiltration intruders current solutions device authentication authorization carried centralized cloud based servers perfectly viable small scale iot networks dozens nodes involved  ecosystems start grow thousands millions sensors gadgets enter fray authentication  bottleneck especially network loses internet connection time
most people understand notion scale says ken tola ceo iot security startup phantom effective security needs provide realistic mechanism control millions devices  nightmare current solutions current options rely internet connections kill batteries overwhelm extremely fragile mesh networks iot systems rely fail completely internet goes tola explains
according tola solution functionality edge devices working peer based manner makes easier handle scale says matter big authentication/authorization takes place devices happen simultaneously millions devices requiring internet access heavy network loads burdensome features
tola startup worked lightweight scalable solution mm (machine machine connections minimal internet connectivity required phantom invisible (thus smart security layer sits device connected network able securely identify devices peer based relationship authorize levels types communication secure conversations devices
local networks secured policies stored nodes policies  distributed cloud delivered bluetooth direct usb sticks strong hash chaining techniques ensure safe transmission new policies leveraging local validation finally provide truly effective security scale securely control millions devices says tola
at core internet things extension worldwide web connectivity computers devices sensors surround connectivity  wireless especially personal area network ensemble wearable portable implanted devices carry person
most iot devices rely radio frequency (rf technology bluetooth zigbee wi fi communications known far field transmission rf great communicating long distances   problematic applied short range isolated iot ecosystems like wireless personal area network
link network security  increasingly difficult number rf devices increases says dr michael abrams ceo freelinc research development corporation handshake encryption protocols projected free space requirement decreasing power consumption wearables translates room encryption protocols issues clearly reflected bluetooth increasingly poor reliability security record
already rf based devices shutting interference situation grow worse iot industry grows billions
one solution  fcc allot additional bandwidth  ghz wi fi  trillions projected devices eventually connect problems recur says dr abrams
another problem rf based wireless communications power consumption  growing issue devices added iot space especially powered batteries  deployed unattended environments
an alternative says abrams substitute near field magnetic induction (nfmi rf nfmi uses modulations magnetic fields transfer data wirelessly points main strength attenuation decays thousand times faster rf signals eliminates interference security issues attributed technologies bluetooth
nfmi solves problems abrams says creates wireless ‘bubble’ user multiple devices connect outside signals  seen security protocols exist bubble projected free space rapid signal decay allows frequency  used just short distance away practically eliminating possibility spectrum contention
nfmi based principle near field communication (nfc new generation smartphones  extends reading distance   inches  feet offers  kbps data transfer rate
nfmi used hearing aids pacemakers mission critical communications than a decade abrams believes prove worth new way age iot
the increased number iot devices quickly turn management nightmare order make best use increased utility provided millions smart meters parking lighting sensors traffic controls crowd movement detection sensors gadgets scattered smart homes cities need  able efficiently control traffic functionality administration integration connectivity  simple possible require human intervention
until iot networks management capacity constrained says yegor popov founder ceo waviot iot networking startup biggest challenges iot networks today number different smart devices sensors transmitting receiving data time challenge needs  addressed order network control
popov specifically alludes low power wide area networks (lpwan huge numbers devices soon share network cities increased numbers nodes require real time allocation resources order improve efficiency prevent interference
based analysts predictions  connect internet additional  billion devices says marat zaripov waviot cmo  billion estimated  lpwan  million new lpwan devices day predictions remotely correct network management  key issues
a human control billion nodes connected wide area popov explains plans solving problem technology  buzzword industries artificial intelligence
waviot using machine learning development dynamic automated network management framework proprietary algorithm dubbed albert provides real time distributed control self management capabilities huge long range iot networks consisting billions smart devices sprawling millions square miles uses trained neural networks bayesian methods optimize interaction nodes iot gateways network
popov calls decentralized living organism adapt based machine learning algorithms provide optimal operation entire network
albert meet challenge real life project sofia bulgarian capital handle million different smart city devices
in ways transformations overcoming internet things huge implications technologies use evolve adapt support needs increasingly connected world  buried weight billions connected devices replaced new technologies ready challenges introduced explosion iot scalability  key winning game survival
