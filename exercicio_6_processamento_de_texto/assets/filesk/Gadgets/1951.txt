i know supposed  talking flappy bird  i think justified bring appears research paper games like flappy bird hard  frustrating turns controls fundamentally bad
that come surprise   angry birds neko atsume work fine  action games mobile tend suffer unresponsive controls turns blame developer much
researchers aalto university finland probably dying  millionth time flappy bird pledging way justify failure scientifically new paper number factors combine make controls unreliable
we finally explain games require accurate timing annoyingly hard touchscreens said author antti oulasvirta news release accompanying paper

first users precisely control high hold finger case physical button maintain physical contact introduces variability timing
second timing sensor event uncertain player ca reliably tell touchscreen actually register touch finger makes slightest contact passes threshold variability introduced

there solutions minimizing regularizing latency thing  good practice making touch events place certain touch maximum threshold reliability accuracy increased error rates dropped  percent finger height  unfortunately does appear  solution that
at weâ€™ve got better handle problem stick real buttons can
