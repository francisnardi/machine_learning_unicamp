we feel strongly customers really looking converged mac ipad cook told newspaper wind doing worried happen experience  good customer wants want make best tablet world best mac world putting achieve you’d begin compromise different ways

his comments clarify remarks earlier month telegraph newspaper publicity drive drum up noise accompany the launch the ipad pro cook had appeared suggest thought there was longer role pcs world increasingly powerful capable tablets
i think looking pc buy pc anymore really buy he told telegraph week yes ipad pro replacement notebook desktop many people start using conclude longer need use  phones

so for instance people do typically conduct communications single platform like facebook  use multiple different apps services  depending talking want say such comms behavior sophisticated simple  (often preferred cook view that users actively seek appreciate distinct computing experiences rather rush to collapse distinctions does feel stretch
of course apple interests maintain value distinct classes computing hardware given business hardware score apple rivals pushing device convergence strategy directly attack value cupertino premium hardware business foregrounding software  just push convergence users does mean people embrace software  eating world  remains  seen gobble up apple hardware business
