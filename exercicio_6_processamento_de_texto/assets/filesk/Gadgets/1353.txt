after traveling years solar juno finally reached destination currently orbit jupiter traveling nearly  kilometers hour ( mph
the dangerous aspect  billion mission launched  occurred evening  pm et juno initiated final approach procedures order successfully insert orbit jupiter (instead flying right past planet crashing juno needed ignite main engine  minutes
now juno successfully completed burn begin  orbits jupiter
during orbits juno repeatedly dive jupiter radiation belts coming  miles jupiter cloud tops closest approach suite scientific instruments juno provide data improve understanding jupiter formation evolution
juno named roman goddess jupiter wife enable scientists jupiter dense cloud cover  before
one reasons this is unique mission destination extremely dangerous known planets solar jupiter largest magnetic field highest radiation juno  specially designed survive extremes long retrieve useful data mysterious planet
to extremes jupiter perspective background radiation exposed earth  rad jupiter juno expected  rad course lifetime
in nasa trailer juno mission scientists descri jupiter unforgiving relentless monster
nasa needed spacecraft strong withstand environment answer juno a nearly  pound spacecraft with three different solar panels stretch  meters length
at beginning jupiter orbit insertion juno carried  kilograms fuel  minute insertion burn completed  kilograms fuel left spacecraft juno use remaining fuel to complete  orbits jupiter ultimately orbit planet itself

the video shows peek spacecraft saw neared final approach  captured junoc camera june th jupiter moons (callisto ganymede europa io  seen equipment board including science instruments junoc turned june th prepare spacecraft dangerous mission jupiter orbit insertion
there long dangerous road ahead juno   goes planned mission end spacecraft orbiting crashing jupiter
