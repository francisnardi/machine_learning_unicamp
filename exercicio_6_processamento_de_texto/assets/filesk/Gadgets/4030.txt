researchers carnegie mellon created realistic looking plastic hair d printed objects does help follicularly challenged humans  does allow add cute hairdos d printed characters simulate hard growth living things
the uses standard d printer special programming extrudes little plastic pulls like hit glue gun hair  placed randomly surface rows  brushed cut
the researchers difficult quickly pull extruding plastic away object using just hot pla extruder instead decided entire plate sideways pulling plastic away surface print head ca rapidly print bed holds work progress rapidly researchers said applying molten material moving print head bed sideways they create hair like strands wanted
you just squirt little bit material pull away said gierad laput phd student carnegie mellon human computer interaction institute simple idea really
you read project  rest assured technique soon enter repertoire d printing tricks order finally d print life sized hairy burt reynolds blue plastic
