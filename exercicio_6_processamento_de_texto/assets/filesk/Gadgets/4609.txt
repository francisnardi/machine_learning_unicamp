in mars related press conference morning nasa has announced certain circumstances liquid water mars
mars dry arid planet thought past said press conference streamed online today
previously known h existed mars form ice  scientists thought atmosphere mars liquid water  possible
the scientists used spectroscopy technique analyze the chemical composition dark streaks (which nasa refers as recurring slope lineae rsl previously observed martian surface streaks noticed vary following temperature changes surface  leading hypothesis substance water
late week the agency trailed major science finding ongoing exploration red planet  showing continued savvy nasa social media mission sustain public space exploration
nasa landed curiosity rover on mars august  and bot exploring surface  nasa extending originally slated year mission end  opportunity rover landed martian surface  is active  currently surveying portion surface called marathon valley
discoveries from curiosity mission date included finding calcium perchlorate in martian soil as spikes methane roved an ancient streambed liquid once flowed unearthed clay minerals drilling martian rock  suggesting aquatic environment planet past 
the rover has measured radiation levels view assessing feasibility humans spending time planet 
the presence of perchlorate martian soil improves stability liquid water surface mars nasa scientists said today  enabling liquid water exist for longer freezing temperature planet drops boiling away its thin atmosphere means mars water briny than pure
the viability life exist water clear stage nasa added   presence liquid water gives huge boost search
my feeling look earth water essential ingredient life… tremendously exciting able answer question ‘does life exist earth’  finding water critical i think great opportunities  right locations mars thoroughly investigate said jim green director planetary science nasa
investigating rsl sites pro life challenging according nasa streaks far observed steep slopes said directly probing contain life likely  domain future robotics spacecraft specifically designed  craft which rigorously sterilized avoid contamination earth based microbes exactly liquid that appears rsl comes unclear stage
the presence liquid water mars help future human mission planet nasa added
it took multiple spacecraft years solve mystery know liquid water surface cold desert planet added michael meyer lead scientist nasa mars exploration progr agency headquarters washington study mars learn life  supported resources support life future
