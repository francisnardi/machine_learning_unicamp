an experimental solar cell created mit researchers massively increase power generated given area panels simultaneously reducing waste heat better sounds super cool scientists talk unoptimized geometry fact break shockley queisser limit
the shockley queisser limit definitely theoretical maximum efficiency solar cell  percent common silicon based ones

sound weird thing solar cells work best certain wavelength light  ultraviolet short infrared long  let say nm (orange visible light perfect broad spectrum radiation emitted sun nm limits energy cell pull radiation  components shockley queisser limit
what bierman te did add step sun cell carefully engineered structure carbon nanotubes carbon nanotubes virtually perfect absorber entire color spectrum said bierman mit news release energy photons gets converted heat
normally heat undesirable solar cell just waste energy interfere normal operation  case heat allowed dissipate instead carbon nanostructure converts heat light  exact optimum wavelength photovoltaic cell
the result huge increase efficiency benefit heat unlike light easy store day sunlight wereÂ entirely converted heat stored away  converted light demand  like say night words technique essentially allows sunlight  saved later
experimental results bore theory prototype tpv cell performed expected  tech needs make lab manufacturing complex carbon nanomaterials bulk simple task wo  using thermophotovoltaics year year   technique tremendously promising unlikely  left shelf
the te research published journal nature energy
