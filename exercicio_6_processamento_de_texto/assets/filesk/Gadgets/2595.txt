today years ford industry defining statement d printing making way forward mainstre allowing  create customized products demand affordable prices longer products need  tailor products meet individual needs little extra cost
are today digital manufacturing capabilities making standardization obsolete possibly  verge replacing mass production altogether sitting edge industrial revolution
to better understand d printing disrupt mass production know it helpful look fundamental differences conventional production technologies
at core mass production scale  cost manufacturing unit decreases production quantity increases principle mechanism investment manufacturing facilities typically produce multiples thing efficiently
producing (and ultimately selling lot things decreases relative cost initial investment turn allows product  sold lower price point increase demand demand continues grow particular product costs production continue relative profit margins unit increase  concept referred economies scale
so economic growth  achieved economies scale realized brings fundamental flaw mass production products  sold produced
 market forecasting million dollar sales teams help guide manufacturing order decisions estimated  percent manufactured goods end waste months rolling production line meaning contents  shipping containers  thrown away reaching consumer
at time products way landfill production facilities low wage countries (including china brazil indonesia working manufacturing order  beginning cycle wasted energy consumption packaging labor raw materials
d printing  additive manufacturing  hand fundamentally different up
from cost perspective does really matter d printed product different additive manufacturing need standardized molds allows fully customized personalized products  produced cost
of course flip d printing does steep price drop bringing economies scale  compared mass production exists today d printed product bring value individual user  generally expensive mass produced product
when products produced d printing modeled purchased digitally manufacturing taken place production demand purchased production products happen locally  local living room even  d printers compact automated locality need stock need shipping importantly waste
with mind wonder question raised repeatedly d industrial revolution replace mass manufacturing creating personalized objects demand sounds good  true it turns mass production remarkably efficient notoriously hard beat standardization price
without question mass manufacturing ideal creating large quantities products standardization beneficial current d printing technologies compete existing prices (or quality core benefits d printing  demand personalization design complexity  add little value product categories exist mass manufacturing space mass manufacturing systems  expected remain dominant form production industries
that said plenty product categories benefits d printing beginning make significant difference specifically include products relatively low quantities (limited scale need personalization simply impossible make conventional manufacturing technologies 
industries fashion aerospace medicine food showing signs disruption introduction additive manufacturing technologies significant benefit d printing replace mass manufacturing current form  introduce entirely new category products
for example everyday thing like nike running shoes models mass manufactured product  standardized size differences notwithstanding  introduction nikeid portland oregon based sportswear giant opened door let users customize product specific needs  aesthetic otherwise
now imagine near future shopping online pair new shoes nikeid server contains complete d scan foot included user account possible customize shoes color  form based exact shape foot
by producing shoes using d printing retailers like nike custom tailor shoes specific user needs  unlike men suits custom tailored hand centuries modern d printers  stored average retail environment home allows custom shoes  printed exactly point purchase
all sudden going manufacturing model produces lot product ships location hopes sale manufacturing model makes sale produces needed and delivers items within  hours course double price existing pair  shoes  hard imagine new breed shoe produced make standardization look like relic past  regardless price
similar examples  used regarding approach food medicine despite nearly person having vastly different dietary health needs dietary health advice standardized millions united states age wearable health monitoring smartphone future puts data good use  prescription meds vitamin supplements customized individual
ultimately look potential d printing clear mass manufacturing  completely eradicated efficiency scale clear benefits specific product categories nonetheless d printing potential create new powerful product category eliminate need complex supply chains excessive waste decentralizing production wealth knowledge
in long run d printing help create decentralized rural based self reliant economy production consumption reunited
