i bought apple watch months ago casual purchase apple fan watch collector  years experience design innovation space i extremely high expectations purchase i enjoyed stylish apple watch features functions i occasionally felt frustrated overall experience admittedly personal reasons
first apple watch wo continuously monitor heart rate history heart disease family i close eye health tracking heart rate course days weeks provide beneficial longitudinal data apple watch designed measure user heart rate workout app launched  wo record moves exactly i want measure (i realize this saves battery life  i’d  happy recharge day functionality
second hard fit apple watch aesthetic life guy collected watches  years i disappointed wearing apple watch meant wearing timepieces i’ve tried wear apple watch watch collection simultaneously wrist  uncomfortable…and i felt like tech nerd (no offense tech nerds  i   i try hide it
so i saw interesting design challenge similar kind i frequently face day day work time i designer consumer i way wear apple watch daily gather continuous heart rate information wear watches i’ve significant experience designing medical devices consumer products i hoping employ knowledge creating solution
my thought body apple watch  separated band  kernel solution watch body engine module potentially  relocated body use watchbands
next came step design process
step  determine apple watch heart rate monitor work worn parts body i created series quick hack models happen i wore watch ankle shoulder forearm abdomen running apple watch successfully monitored heart rate worn ankle shoulder forearm   abdomen likely apple photoplethysmography process relies reading flow blood insufficient visible blood flow abdomen
step  figure body wear watch engine i quickly saw options…especially i wanted  able view watch screen times ankle shoulder inherent visibility  screen access challenges i settled upper forearm location i wear watch engine discretely underneath long sleeved shirt  invisible sleeves rolled accessible needed
step  devise process attaching apple watch forearm easy way attach forearm apple watch bands long encircle forearm screen improperly oriented viewing meant apple watch band connection points probably  used hold forearm
step  prototype knowing apple watch body module effectively read heart rate forearm i began creating wearable prototypes hold watch forearm end i built prototypes
a skin safe clear adhesive leveraged medical products (tegaderm covers watch body advantages easy apply holds arm disadvantages adhesive looks creepy skin apple watch screen little hard adhesive

the watch body held clear film pocket plastic frame flexible fabric strap added secure watch body forearm the strap worked watch body easily  inserted removed  looks designed bulky arm

a clear watch body case attached flexible strap (brought forward the second prototype apple watch snaps case holds watch body proper orientation provides a traditional look  like smartphone holding exercise strap  comfortable easy/quick configuration limits use forearm (and ankle ideally i’d like solution i wear parts body

a clear watch body case attached flexible fabric patch medical skin safe adhesive (from prototype applied underside patch watch body snaps clear case advantages easy apply holds arm  used multiple locations body disadvantages

working design industry regularly resonance testing giving prototypes consumers understand target attributes resonate testing process finding statistical winner focuses concept evolution  carrying forward successful aspects idea  test apple watch engine n  i followed similar approach evolving concept brining best attributes subsequent concepts
in end fourth prototype apple patch effectively fit life apple patch
the watch body held place clear plastic case attached skin safe adhesive patch allowed wear unobtrusively wearing favorite watches collection allowed flexibility wear different locations body the patch  customized various colors patterns redesign allowed apple watch continuously feed information heart rate just i desired fact i’m rolling sleeve looking apple watch i type report heart rate 
the apple watch hack provided good lessons
prototype learn  experiential prototyping testing core designer approach i excited quickly i able evolve improve design creating informal testing models appreciate importance agile like approach innovation failing forward fast
every innovation  customized improved consumers unique needs companies support encourage customization products services create maker movement home d printing grows  important empower consumers  design innovation process
