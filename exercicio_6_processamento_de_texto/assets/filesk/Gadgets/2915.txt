when famously said there reason  want computer home  ken olson founder digital equipment corporation certainly expecting reality like live today
in half century computers just exist multiple rooms homes they’ve taken pockets wrists embedded multitude products including light bulbs basketballs needless say plenty reasons anybody want computer home
 olson worst tech predictions time variations question continue  asked seemingly new major technological advancement  particularly need d printer home
the ability design manufacture physical object home hours bypassing traditional manufacturing supply chains certainly powerful notion replacing  dishwasher took literally minutes  d printing material weeks lengthy phone customer service representative  dishwasher parts does need replacing regular basis
despite possibilities hitting print d printer lot involved just loading paper tray hitting green button preparing finishing d printed object  arduous process
for regularly use d printer process stride usually small issues  ready challenge make pleasurable experience turn sour fast short ease use thing
in addition operational difficulties involved owning maintaining d printer d printing applications average person justify cost purchasing   machine unless using d printer line work hobby regularly spend thousands dollars year small plastic parts time costs involved d printer ownership just worth it

having access d printer certainly ideal creative engineering fields wish envision ideas thoughts prototypes physically
this d printed objects exist today tool design thinking iteration continue future increasingly dependent stem skill sets access d printer  invaluable tool students learning foundations science technology engineering math
still frequent users d printing turned d printing services increasingly making ownership unattractive commit large purchase add clutter final product delivered hassle ownership maintenance
to  fair  price ease use things consider d printers  easy use cheaper year range applications really fundamental limit current adoption rate d printing
unlike personal computers countless number tasks home d printers limited thing creating physical objects digital files looking olson  prediction comparing role d printing home today  clearer thought way did  just applications justify owning personal computer
if d printers  taken seriously universal home appliance need provide solutions valuable home personal computers evolved level value  machine produce occasional spare small product plastic does not
when thinking home applications potentially possible home d printing hard exciting future ahead  developments addition advanced materials enable users produce variety functional objects demand  ability print electronics sensors directly d print like voxel printer example hitting market year
similarly developments d printing glass ceramics metals greatly expand potential applications home

a clear example role d printers home affect day day lives ability print everyday objects demand commonly used home object owned purely functional benefits like kitchen knife knife access functional benefits given time example dinner necessarily want knife want access ability cut something
using currently imaginary d printer print (and dispose functional knife demand need knife simply print needed dispose ultimately true digitalization products comes view powerful notion potential redefine materialism altogether   seeing potential  easier imagine role d printer home
similar reasoning holds true d printed edibles living future consisting smartwatches track vitals sending data food based d printer allow machine prepare optimal meal nutritional supplements individual day want replace microwave kitchen new appliance capable producing meals near instantly personally compiled fresh ingredients
looking forward potential home d printing tremendous scratched surface come mind methods moving forward  like evolution computers  fuzzy unclear looking current state technology i foresee need d printer home time near future big question i  wrong mr olson was
