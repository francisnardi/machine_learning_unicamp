robots need excitement lives provide instead they’ll incite violence common sense simple common sense  robots need trash trashbot cool robotic trash automatically sort garbage pitching metals non recyclables project relative infancy  surprisingly cool clever
created pittsburgh vaish krishnamurthy cmu professor koushil sreenath trashbot basically series ramps metal materials touch sensitive plates ramps switch lead trash proper receptacle te hax raised  build simple   working  prototype
the idea project comes confusion caused recycling rules exception obvious items (eg plastic bottles glass bottles cardboard people really understand items actually recyclable personally i questioned ‘rules wondering example like plastic bag inside cereal box recyclable goes saying i  questions said krishnamurthy confusion leads good recycling conscious citizens trying questionable recyclables possible recycling stre thinking doing right thing doing so
all confusion ruins recycling stre contaminates piles
and piles junk recycling centers robot  trained time figure difference piece food grade cardboard amazon box
in short te building robot tell pizza box  recycled thrown away cheese stripped paper eaten days consumption actual pizza
as project progresses plan use combination manual training data accumulation increasing accuracy efficiency trashbot said krishnamurthy thing sure   worse   recycling rate humans achieving today main reasons significant need product
may someday soon robot start processing trash food prospect encourage robots eat us
