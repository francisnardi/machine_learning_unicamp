the promise d printing kind dud aside cool yoda heads small plastic pieces indie players doing interesting space markforged markforged boston company featured year that makes carbon fiber reinforced plastic parts using traditional d printing techniques means objects print stronger lighter resilient steel
now they’ve added precise list markforged mark x unique d printer uses laser scanning ensure pieces come machine precisely ordered words send objects strength quality expecting says founder greg mark aerospace engineer mit grad
we invented continuous fiber reinforcement ( issued patents process laser micrometer quality control said we’ve pushed surface finish plastic extrusion approach surface finish sla machine combines strength surface finish quality control enable end use parts supply chains  same
essentially prints fine strong objects constantly tests structural accuracy send object  printer ejects exactly requested exactly right measurements
the process quality control based laser micrometer integrated print head  micron z axis resolution  micron x/y resolution high resolution scans pull dimensions real time use check accuracy said mark
the print heads plastic carbon fiber set hardness object manufacture importantly control light object i’ve seen markforged products solid steel  light plastic surprisingly cool thanks measurement basically send objects printer office thousand miles away ensure object comes exactly designed unrivaled strength words instead sending milled piece steel send print digital file
current markforged owners discount mark x  given thing  i doubt hobbyists pick coolest implementations d printing i’ve seen pretty darn close teleportation
