commercially operated autonomous drones  horizon especially google amazon announced plans start drone based parcel delivery  policy problem likely follow allocation scarce airspace preferred flight paths  issue complicated need ensure drone flight safe flight path segment stays capacity
the default solution regulating drone traffic skies  open like existing rules govern roads limits placed participation flights controlled operating regulations natural congestion leading inefficient oversubscribed slow dangerous  heavily regulated companies bother fly drones
an alternative solution follows mechanisms allocate electricity  smart market drone airspace flight paths smart market auction relies mathematical optimization resolve complex rules associated allocating resource smart markets widely used include diverse examples advertisers bid place ads google adwords australian government bushtender auction protecting improving native vegetation private land
in electricity markets multiple power plants produce electric power  demand varies time electric smart markets use computer progr allow cheapest power  delivered plants best able offer ensure blackouts power flow does overload power lines power plants electricity providers submit bids simultaneously market makes certain allocation fits needs requirements market participants regulators
these systems help markets self regulate modern electricity markets incentivize companies expand generating capacity assure users buy power assure regulators business practices follow physical constraints legal mandates researchers similar smart market proposals determine airport landing assignments regulate path finding autonomous cars
a smart market drone airspace work like  create bid particular flight path time slot fly specific drone computer based market clearing mechanism ensure drone valid flight path capacity
the smart market  run public auction operated airspace managers used fly drones market  inherently flexible complex regulation allowing improvements need new laws would likely  transparent users mechanisms allocate permits based complex regulatory criteria require ongoing management
the key components smart market initial rights (who controls existing right airspace model allocation respects physical regulatory requirements
airspace permission fly drone currently controlled confusing combination landowners federal aviation administration public county city drone flying solution smart market require clarification rights
the allocation model drone airspace work like electricity markets  taking account safety concerns physical limits participants needs
for instance safety regulations dictate drones  kept certain distance apart noise ordinances certain times day restrict schedules given flight pass sequence flight segments varying degrees congestion multiple time slots  allocated highest sum bids non conflicting flight paths bidders  required pay lowest winning bid price slot plus specified cost provide flight control
the burden ensuring companies follow established rules rest flight controller using established like nasa unmanned aerial traffic management common airspace models developed privately companies want fly drones wo need worry patchwork local laws laws  incorporated market clearing computer model locals decide fewer drones overhead expensive drone delivery
after drones  widespread capacity diminish making prices increase resulting revenue cost providing flight control excess revenue  allocated city county flights took place creates incentives governments reduce unnecessary restrictions
yes smart market is complicated fortunately companies clamoring use drones like amazon google sophisticated users operate similar markets businesses designing effectively implementing it  simple rapid means initial work designing need start soon preferably support drone industry regulators and diligent monitoring evaluation
some people worry smart market drones benefit users expense   worse heavily regulated systems create vested interests lead regulatory capture industry gains control agency meant regulate it
due vested interests bureaucratic momentum smart markets historically nearly impossible implement different place consumers drone operators stand benefit smart market drone airspace  regulators opt build different smart market opportunity probably  lost
waiting problems emerge smart markets likely solve like congestion regulation best path forward unless policymakers clarify airspace rights act soon opportunity establish smart market  lost like drone disappearing horizon
