tor anonymous communication online years  juiciest targets possible likes nsa fbi new anonymizing protocol mit prove resilient determined deep pocketed attackers
the potential problem tor adversary gets nodes network work track progress packets  able tell exactly sent  breadcrumb trail tying user traffic coming exit node  theory
a te researchers led mit grad student albert kwon (with help epfl aims leapfrog tor anonymizing technique brand new platform called riffle
tor aims provide lowest latency possible opens certain attacks wrote kwon email techcrunch riffle aims provide traffic analysis resistance possible

first servers switch order received messages passed node preventing  scrutinizing incoming outgoing traffic tracking packets using metadata
then comes measure prevent malicious server simply replacing real messages dummies tracking single target messages sent user servers just  outgoing messages  signed independently verifiable mathematical proof ones server received way server tampering messages  spotted once
both techniques  mixnets dining cryptographer networks respectively  existed independently years  drawbacks prevented adopted let dcns did scale requiring lot bandwidth proofs needed mixnets computationally expensive latency low

the key advance kwon te implementing way weaknesses avoided read technical details paper (pdf  gist uses mix public key symmetric cryptography dissimilar works web
with change resulting network resistant active passive attacks  scales does use processing time file sharing hundreds users theoretically reach  kb/s according researchers estimates bandwidth intensive use like microblogging handle  users  seconds latency
that kwon wrote servers running gigabit lan  adding servers counterintuitively actually degrade performance way
the servers secure wrote kwon terms performance messages servers servers performant is
small secure networks ubiquitous global ones idea   anonymous nodes serve country community
there downloadable version riffle right  kwon said heâ€™d like clean code bit really just prototype present plan commercialize  replacement tor does things vastly better
there incompatible design goals kwon wrote  complementary taking advantage security riffle large anonymity set size tor
keep eye kwon site updates
