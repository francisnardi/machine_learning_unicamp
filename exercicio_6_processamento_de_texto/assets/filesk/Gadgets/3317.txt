by pretty good chance you’ve seen new star wars movie  not worry spoilers long we’ve got needed dose starfighters rebel alliances lasers droids bb  adorable successor r d captured hearts minds lovable life creators managed instill end… super sophisticated prop wondering heck does thing work
while jj kept specifics bb  innards wraps suss basics trilling orange white sphere bb  likely set wheels (propelling sphere spinning inner wall magnetic mast (to hold control bb  head sort wobbly way bb  moves inherent design   considered flaw used  helps bb  character
that explanation leave lot wanting want detailed breakdown read folks
a lot analysis internet today people treating bb  discrete operations head ball patents filed disney partner sphero paints different picture patent magnetically coupled accessory self propelled device explains bb  work separately controlled head combine sphero chief scientist ad wilson telling polygoncom head articulated independently start paint picture internals look like
the strongest justification kind watching bb  try lean does  able maintain constant head angle static strongly implies head articulated independently consistent patent
let things rolling
the head complicates things let just think body image patents extremely helpful illustration make things simple let think problem dimensions looking forward backward motion principles apply stable all happening bb  turns internal assembly yawing point different direction
in nutshell we’ve got sphere wheeled mechanism inside wheels forced wall bb  way (either spring gravity does matter huge deal rotating wheels shifts center mass bulk wheel assembly the vertical line includes center ball contact point ground leaning generates moment do right ball moves direction wheels shifted picture mast mounted perpendicularly wheel base ball direction opposite mast

in broad strokes similar like zorb ball moving heaviest thing zorb moving forward changes position relative ball center mass end leads rotation forward motion (we going dynamics problem  reach really want know

a head math
that mast talked earlier bb  head goes attached mast sphere makes sense  attached magnetically patent dictates lots ways  lets bb  bounce function like does movie involves set attractive repelling magnets repulsion probably keeps head contacting ball magnetic attraction edges head keeps rolling off

earlier went bb  wanted mast (and head point direction opposite motion movie bb  head tilted direction motion know head ca separately does work

again bb  floppy motion tells lot notice bb  starts moving forward tilt brief period moving head rolling backward applying dynamics problem helps explain going on
to clear things i think inverted pendulum problem easy draw comparisons let pull concept typical inverted pendulum problem school inverted pendulum shaft pointed direction motion backwards little bit let shaft fall place reverse direction motion
image bryce durbin
similarly i suspect brief period minimal motion base moving  bb  doing similar likely bb  gets motion slowly (without noticeable backward head shift slowing motors head allowed roll forward head pointing forward resume motors nice tilt roll shown movies  alternately possible motors drive mast forward letting ball backwards motors maintain constant angle bb  moves forward mast wheel assembly inertia relative rest need tiny initial motion getting started
all easier said control law sensor suite running  incredibly sophisticated  making running bb  software problem hardware problem
calibration key
since entire operation depends knowing angle offset vertical (θ control needs  able measure extreme accuracy saw bb  needing  calibrated techcrunch lucas matney played scale model toy earlier year feeds closed loop control maintains angle (θ offset center value set value set software depending fast want bb  go

all said does mean bb  comes handling restrictions really simpler just use method analysts predicted i designers  it just cool  a lot broad strokes based video patent filings possible i’m entirely wrong bb  does else
