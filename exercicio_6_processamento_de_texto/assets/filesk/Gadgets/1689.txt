if hungry little holographic data storage transfer morning i got flapjack researchers university witwatersrand johannesburg packed  times data light stre using pair holographic spatial light modulators encode decode transmissions

their paper published nature details process involving argon ion laser small holographic screen laser paints patterns spatial light modulator picked spatial light modulator sent camera resulting patterns encode massive amounts data quickly
obviously esoteric technology  important realize doing etching different patterns   able encode sorts information single light  current state art usually sends simple on/off signal sends things far complex
will  shooting lasers future probably  little engineering add sort fast connectivity future devices allowing speed light data transfer amazingly high bandwidths
