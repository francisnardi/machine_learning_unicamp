all these scenarios  many more  will  realized thanks internet things (iot the industries historically did fit computers transformed billions iot devices connected internet industries follow suit billions enter fray
the possibilities virtually countless especially power iot combined technologies machine learning  major hurdles surface billions smart devices want interact  owners challenges  met current models supporting iot communications tech firms researchers hoping deal blockchain technology constitutes backbone famous bitcoin
current iot ecosystems rely centralized brokered communication models known server/client paradigm devices identified authenticated connected cloud servers sport huge processing storage capacities connection devices exclusively internet happen  feet apart
while model connected generic computing devices decades continue support small scale iot networks today  able respond growing needs huge iot ecosystems tomorrow
existing iot solutions expensive high infrastructure maintenance cost associated centralized clouds large server farms networking equipment sheer communications  handled iot devices grow tens billions increase costs substantially
even unprecedented economical engineering challenges overcome cloud servers remain bottleneck point failure disrupt entire network especially important critical tasks human health life  dependent iot
moreover diversity ownership devices supporting cloud infrastructure makes machine machine (mm communications difficult single platform connects devices guarantee cloud services offered different manufacturers interoperable compatible
a decentralized approach iot networking solve questions adopting standardized peer peer communication model process hundreds billions transactions devices significantly reduce costs associated installing maintaining large centralized data centers distribute computation storage needs billions devices form iot networks prevent failure single node network bringing entire network halting collapse
however establishing peer peer communications present set challenges chief  issue security know iot security just protecting sensitive data proposed solution maintain privacy security huge iot networks offer form validation consensus transactions prevent spoofing theft
blockchain offers elegant solution peer peer communication platform problem technology allows creation distributed digital ledger transactions shared  nodes network instead stored central server participants registered blockchains  able record transactions technology uses cryptography authenticate identify participating nodes and allow securely add transactions ledger transactions verified confirmed nodes participating network eliminating need central authority
the ledger tamper proof  manipulated malicious actors does exist single location man middle attacks  staged single thread communication  intercepted blockchain makes trustless peer peer messaging possible proven worth world financial services cryptocurrencies bitcoin providing guaranteed peer peer payment services need party brokers
tech firms mulling porting usability blockchain realm iot
the concept directly  ported iot networks deal issue scale allowing billions devices share network need additional resources blockchain addresses issue conflict authority different vendors providing standard equal stakes benefits
this helps unlock mm communications practically impossible previous models allows realization totally new use cases
the iot blockchain combination gaining momentum endorsed startups tech giants ibm samsung introduced proof concept adept uses blockchain support generation iot ecosystems generate hundreds of billions transactions day
in papers descri use blockchain iot ibm paul brody describes new devices  initially registered universal blockchain assembled manufacturer later transferred regional blockchains sold dealers customers autonomously interact devices share blockchain
the combination iot blockchain creating possibility circular economy liquefying capacity assets resources  shared reused instead purchased disposed use iot hackathon hosted blockchain platform leader ethereum concept blockchain powered iot test interesting ideas presented including domain energy sharing electricity gas billing
filament startup investing iot blockchain focus industrial applications agriculture manufacturing oil gas filament uses wireless sensors called taps create low power autonomous mesh networks data collection asset monitoring requiring cloud central network authority firm uses blockchain technology identify authenticate devices charge network data services bitcoin
chain things consortium exploring role blockchain dealing scale security issues iot recent hackathon held london group demonstrated use blockchain iot case study involving solar energy stack designed provide reliable verifiable renewable data speeding incentive settlements reducing opportunities fraud facilitates process solar panel connects data logger tracks solar energy produced securely delivers data node records distributed ledger synced broader global network nodes
the application blockchain iot flaws shortcomings hurdles need  overcome thing dispute  bitcoin developers architecture underlying blockchain technology roots problems stemming growth network rise number transactions issues inevitably apply extension blockchain iot challenges acknowledged tech firms solutions including chains tree chains mini blockchains tested fix problem
processing power energy consumption point concern encryption verification blockchain transactions computationally intensive operations require considerable horsepower carry lacking iot devices goes storage ledgers start grow size need  redundantly stored network nodes
and machina research analyst jeremy green explains autonomous iot networks powered blockchain pose challenges business models manufacturers seeking includes long term subscription relationships continuing revenue streams big shift business economic models  required
