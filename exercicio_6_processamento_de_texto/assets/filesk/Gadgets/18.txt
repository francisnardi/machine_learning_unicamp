the proximity sensors monitor far away bits hand collating information larger picture position wrist data sent instantly watch drives virtual cursor tilting hand moves cursor on
tilt pattern launch switch apps scroll play games using second hand detects gestures want sensor detects sound tap thumb index finger (! turns recognition software off

there gyros accelerometers smart watches  having watch want zoom map pretty weak especially you’ve seen wristwhirl action
will look insane flipping wrist staring watch yes  onlookers soon know convenience form input  mainstre remember used look people talking bluetooth headsets (actually look way
now i think  really hurting lack able use smartwatch carrying groceries (shades terrible video   clever solution course thing looks like bomb present quite ready deployment  future version easily  smaller really developers field day futuristic
