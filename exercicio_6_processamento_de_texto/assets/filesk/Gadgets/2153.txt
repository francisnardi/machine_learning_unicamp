computers mobile devices running rich operating systems plethora security solutions encryption protocols that protect multitude threats face soon  connected internet case iot
of billions iot devices presently use considerable percentage sporting low end processing power storage capacity capability  extended security solutions connected internet nonetheless extremely hostile environment
basically like going battlefield without armor
that new iot vulnerabilities constantly surfacing countless iot devices falling victim hacks botnets evil deeds day takes mere minutes malicious hacker thousands vulnerable devices search engine shodan compromised iot devices frequently  beachheads hacks networks line smart devices inherently dumb protect (and cyberattacks
 gap  bridged machine learning analytics especially readily available developers manufacturers
iot devices generating tons data machine learning employed analyze peruse data help improve efficiency customer service reduce costs energy consumption mechanics  employed security related use cases determining safe device behavior general usage patterns subsequently help spot block abnormal activity potentially harmful behavior
already tech firms drawing offer solutions enhance iot security especially smart homes defined security standards practices
machine learning behavioral analysis biggest trends detecting days says alexandru balan chief security researcher cybersecurity tech firm bitdefender elaborates machine learning long way needs  lot research innovation developing implementing testing algorithms
bitdefender approach aggregate cloud server data endpoints rely products input analyzed determine patterns spot malicious behavior gather traffic says balan sanitize normalize learn servers devices talk devices talk normally interact internet pick abnormal traffic
bitdefender uses cloud based intelligence pattern recognition local network analysis suite endpoint security software hardware control internet traffic home networks block connections malicious urls malware downloads suspicious packets leveraging cloud services enabled company bring enterprise level intelligence protection consumer space
machine learning critical component developing artificial intelligence iot security says uday veeramachaneni founder ceo patternex problem iot  distributed massively attack react real time
most systems relying machine learning behavior analysis gather information network connected devices subsequently seek everything normal problem primitive method produces false alarms false positives
the approach suggested patternex develop solution incorporates machine learning augments human analyst insight greater attack detection way address real time create learning takes outliers solicits human feedback veeramachaneni explains human distinguish malicious benign feedback returns to create predictive models mimic human judgment   huge scale real time
this especially pertinent iot ecosystems large numbers devices involved real time analysis overwhelming data generated human abilities
patternex uses machine learning algorithms outlier detection trains model  accurate real time training human analyst spot new attack happening generates events indicate potential attacks human investigates events determines correct assessment learns experience makes accurate decisions time
this model helps improve threat detection accuracy decrease number false positives dramatically time veeramachaneni says
iot devices designed carry limited set functions bit machine learning data  pretty easy identify anomalous behavior idea leveraged startup tech company dojo labs create smart home iot security solution
when comes iot devices designed very specific function says yossi atias founder ceo company assuming lot users using camera smart tv smart alarm smart lock real reason device behave different running software user change
dojo labs method involves collecting metadata different endpoints defining behavior range device type order  able spot block malicious behavior solutions involving machine learning dojo labs model improves collects more data customers
the solution includes pebble like device gets installed home network mobile app allows user control device monitor network status cloud service data consolidated analyzed using proprietary statistical tech mathematical models coupled machine learning algorithms
machine learning promising  infancy long way means  considered complete solution machine learning going  virtually says veeramachaneni security enterprise iot realm powerful machines organizing data crunching data seeking patterns data  need human intuition spot new attacks train stop new (and old attacks
veeramachaneni calls combination augmented intelligence alternative acronym ai strengths man machine converge defeat cyber threats machine learning humans says
