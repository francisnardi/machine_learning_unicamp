kindle unfortunately just  getting closer
the new radically different squarish oasis design beautiful arguably enticing newest shiny e reader  like older versions latest kindle lagging touch response  forget easily thumbing pages writing margins quickly pulling title tedious
the visuals better earlier voyage  ppi resolution  does  extra built led lights
and starting price  compared a  kobo aura ho ipad mini   does e reader  consumers
though e ink display easier eyes ipad added buttons flipping pages help speed process bit
here oasis wins  travel
e readers better hauling heavy books general  the lighter slimmer surprisingly sturdy oasis easy throw bag  molded polymer housing beating  access  million books amazon expanding list of titles (up   modest  gb storage device
the  day battery life (when hooked dual battery cover makes oasis great travel companion long voyages
