in recent years researchers companies exploring new ways improve buildings analytics software prefabrication connected devices new materials construction automation striking efforts trying patch problems legacy framework permanent construction
the assumption buildings  designed constructed permanent objects commonly treated axiom  thing taken granted biggest problem buildings products
buildings permanent  tend think mental construct determines way design construct operate regulate buildings just like cars planes buildings complex products components different service lives
in permanent buildings components stitched useful lifetimes
wires plumbing electronics practically buried inside walls floors ceilings makes upgrades renovations road inevitably messy time consuming expensive
renovations permanent buildings require partial demolition possibility fully reuse materials components according epa building renovations contribute  percent construction waste just demolition itself
at end life permanent buildings need  demolished creates long term environmental problem construction demolition waste amounts   percent landfill volume (epa continue building usual non recyclable demolition waste increasing perpetuity
what concerning majority cases parts buildings building  morally functionally obsolete long physical end life
according survey actual service lives north american buildings …no meaningful relationship exists structural material average service life … buildings demolished reasons physical state structural systems
urban economic cycles shorter given building useful life span means permanent buildings  harmful countercyclical
as buildings designed  permanent putting new devices inside walls floors ceilings require new construction interventions ironically wireless internet allows connected devices  placed relatively constrained legacy infrastructure   location electric wires outlets permanent walls

to avoid barrier multiple startups making standalone devices  placed inside permanent buildings  standalone devices different purposes use lots similar identical components nascent objects analysis claims  percent home electronic devices launched   built just  common electronic components room scale  redundant wasteful pushes overall cost
in industries computers programmable os killed standalone devices recently tesla managed turn cars programmable gadgets customizable interfaces buildings ultimate gadgets
if end goal seamless programmable environment building  ultimate packaging iot infrastructure standalone devices (just like mainframe hidden inside computer phone
one emerging example integrated smart home run apple home os developed brookfield residential ironically buildings end outdated soon built (similarly happened apartments hotel rooms permanently installed old iphone docks walls integration smart home/office infrastructure permanent building framework future proof
we’ve run vicious circle obsolete permanent buildings lead standalone devices poor experience standalone devices leads new generation integrated permanent buildings end obsolete again
the way break pattern make buildings modular reconfigurable upgradeable prerequisite future programmable built environment
a sustainable approach construction  designed useful life different building components buildings  regarded complex modular objects permanent sculptures
this approach somewhat similar way electronics cars designed manufactured electronics common standards like usb ports proprietary standards like apple lightning connectors remain unchanged generation products makes possible upgrade small share components newer models initiate trade programs aimed refurbishing reusing components longer useful lives

japanese large scale prefabrication companies pioneered approach buildings upgradeable gadgets decades ago according linner and bock focus japanese prefabrication industry shifting service design related building life cycle
for example companies like sekisui house track components service lives proactively conduct maintenance upgrade work similar way cars serviced toyota housing provides building apartment layout reconfiguration services sekisui house goes far provide trade programs used buildings exchange newer constructions
japan demonstrated world modular building  high quality serviced industrial gadgets world approach gotten traction united states couple organizations working improving building reusability modularity reconfiguration
open building institute started campaign modular reconfigurable building kits days ago obi standardizes building blocks allow building reconfiguration structure lifetime moment diy somewhat similar wikihouse  higher integration utilizing shelf building materials
kasita austin based startup working standardized micro living pods  easily transported different locations involve entire cities kasita introduced modular interior wall allows users personalize upgrade time pods reconfigurable
in commercial buildings google presented vision reconfigurable campus based realization company idea evolve organizationally   years envisioned campus  flexible adapt future holds

reusability upgradeability buildings  important lens evaluation emerging construction smart home solutions example concrete d printing promoted promising construction technology projects china uae and netherlands received press attention d printing buildings  following dead end branch construction technology evolution operates legacy framework permanent buildings
one important constraint transition reusable reconfigurable buildings appears  cultural purely technological image buildings timeless fortresses numbers suggests ingrained western culture (in japan example cultural attitude different acceptable design buildings relatively shorter useful life design reusable reconfigurable building ensure given moment time they permanent
