a robot a unique personality sound like oxymoron science fiction  goal london based startup emotech launching stage techcrunch disrupt london  today plan crowdfund product voice controlled robot assistant called olly early year
the bot takes form an animated eyeball housed lamp shaped cup designed roll tabletop thought large blinking eyeball swivels look you speak  and talks  makes feel uneasy  bot you
emotech insists look going cute creepy the te includes ex dreamworks animator worked movies including rise guardians croods
right olly just prototype te demo troubles prototype stage  vision smart lifestyle assistant says founder chelsea chen  have a unique personality based personality particular owner interact olly what your personal interests  used determine the tonality your bot says
based ai machine learning create special persuading owner olly special personality says chen olly  different to my olly personality different to mine lifestyle different
for example… i’m quite curious olly pro active talks fast time i try communicate olly olly  try information options suggest  person logical information olly like emotional olly   data driven
four emotech super fans science fiction movies mind building robot dre  thing really want adds
but what exactly olly voice commanded home connected devices  app based voice assistants like apple siri  olly will  able perform info look ups telling weather going  like providing wake in the morning
it will also  able  used hub controlling multiple smart home devices ask dim smart lights say music wireless speakers (or on its speakers launches devices services  able hook include nest philips hue fitbit pebble ifttt spotify various social media services according team
beyond basic connected voice command stuff  course already do device like amazon echo example  the idea olly be doing autopiloting domestic lifestyle needs gets know better learns your habits
for example  like listen particular type music home work olly figure relevant tunes  you’ve time say ‘hey olly play smooth jazz’
how long take the bot adapt routines depend like often says founder hongbin zhuang weekly activity like reading weeks learn preferences  example let say wake morning daily workout data frequently means does need lot time learn curve adds
the bot flagship functionality focused smarter scheduling designed help time poor professionals need little help optimizing routines you could example tell it a general goal helping you read books month  set prompting (hopefully opportune moments thinks window busy schedule to sit read
the basic concept little bit like nest adds zhuang olly can… evolve personality based users preferences patterns
initially user let olly know want achieve  kind lifestyle want based olly going  able help user organize schedule make proposals  example better time reading better time jogging
the underlying os olly based android te intends release sdk expand functions device will  able to offer  envisaging an app store model helping to grow olly utility help outside developers
in terms device works it will listen continually for voice trigger command sending voice data its cloud platform processing founders claim wo  harvesting data mining private conversations  recording stuff directing (they also say the user  able delete data sent by olly cloud companion app
as equipped sensitive microphones designed pick voice commands general domestic chaos olly camera facial recognition computer vision powered image processing bot figure it looking respond accordingly
facial detection locally device  facial recognition requires cloud processing olly detects face vicinity takes photo uploads cloud try figure looking at (it designed physically turn face person speaking like social robot making jibo
through face voice recognition olly knows direct owner  olly tell guest adds chen explaining happen robot encounters person it does know
she says process introducing new people olly  controlled direct owner  like real friends introduction  owner presumably say ‘olly friend gemma’ bot record photo person face future reference
eyeing market 
olly year half away arriving the market does mover advantage space ‘social robots advanced stage development aforementioned jibo or softbank pepper not mention the various voice assistants  app form like siri connected device like amazon echo so plenty competition lining sell concept ai powered convenience consumers
it questionable consumer desire there for this sort tech  especially it really useful is capable nascent stage capabilities  useful bit catch  situation apple siri is now remains an ios feature killer app
despite challenges emotech te upbeat about mission mainstre adoption robot assistants    spending time effort building olly te expects a timeframe of three years social robots start gaining traction mainstre pointing smart home devices tipping point consumers feeling hassled want a robot minion domestic lifting
emotech has raised £ angel funding so far undisclosed chinese investor will  setting initial target  raise their crowdfunding campaign next february  hoping pull closer 
we huge potential smart home market going   billion devices connected internet home devices says zhuang need kind smart hub help people interact kind devices
in terms olly compares similar rival device stage (jibo stress the market positioning different  latter being pitched device family olly intended  personal a robot assistant for an individual other members household  able to interact robot they’ll general responses  tailored tonality true owner hear
olly designed  portable rival devices envisage people carrying house they move room to room different parts their domestic routine so it built battery they say  good some eight hours operational time ( between three hours active use charge
whether people really want scoop carry digital eyeball house especially given they probably smartphone with them  wearable devices  remains  seen cost wise fixed retail price point yet  chen suggests olly  region £ £
the original idea making personalized robot assistant came zhuang completing human computer interaction course university college london make hardware device just app embodiment says product let say smartphone device treat like creature kind emotional system
whether consumers warm to an adaptable device like olly were a human view it as just another gadget filled algorithms is an open ended question right  one which depends on whether ai live sci fi dreams
judges q&a
q question future company  ambition away hardware license ai outa building hardware believe interaction people tech hardware voice detection going  accurate example smartphone
this product going open platform integrate provide ai companies
q carry olly interact it
a final  smaller lighter general olly going live main places going interact example living room morning wake going build voice detection microphone detect room
when cooking olly kitchen sleep you
q does differ amazon echoa terms echo lot similar devices market trying make interaction robot user human like different emotions personality based personality
