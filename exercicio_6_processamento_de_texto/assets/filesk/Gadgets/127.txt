back old days hardware manufacturers felt safe knowledge mere hardware hacker attempt recreate inventions sony philips lg samsung consumer electronics industry locked crack case meddling arduino kids came along…
now  make cool hardware thanks arduino easier connect devices internet data outside world eslov iot invention kit official arduino product adds internet things capabilities hardware products trying build connected fridge beat samsung eslov want knock sony perch try popping eslov unit arduino board major manufacturers living room
think eslov sort mindstorms steroids self described plug play toolkit lets connect multiple sensors outputs create various systems chart shows possible permutations controlled arduino online ide

the consists various sensors wi fi hub interestingly sensor runs atmegap processor arduino uno entry level  kit includes wifi motion hub button buzzer led pro model includes hall sensor oled display gps   modules total    intermediate kit contain need started however
the company raising kickstarter looking hefty  they’ve hit k far  little love maker community i think kit ship july
