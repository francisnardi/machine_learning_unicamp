in effort save costs really makes lot sense mars  rover going share lot hardware curiosity design brand new platform old doing fabulous job

normally phase b  largely concept research work  instead reinventing space wheel mars  just outfits mission focused search life equipped tools specific job  eye future missions trying own
the landing zone  chosen perceived suitability life  ancient rivers mild temperatures sort thing  mars   doing scraping surface clues new coring drill rack sample tubes deposit core samples future collection analysis
careful examination martian resources help determine feasibility things like harvesting oxygen elements environment manned missions ground penetrating radar watch interesting formations beneath surface usual set crazy cameras sensors record manner interesting readings planetologists decipher home

perhaps exciting addition average earthling microphone record sounds rover descent landing  ambient noise surface
this  great opportunity public hear sounds mars time saidÂ matt wallace mars  deputy project manager provide useful engineering information
what sound like probably quiet considering atmosphere   cool nonetheless
the landing  improved sky crane  employed delivery vehicle deploys parachute powered hover platform deposits rover surface  upgrades
