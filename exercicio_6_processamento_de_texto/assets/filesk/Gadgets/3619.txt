assuming human eye wireless signals surrounded homes businesses cities look like like streams of ascii characters depicted matrix sadly reality like sponge says cognitive systems founder taj manku
if actually rf looks like  like example let say eyes it looks odd like looking fo like looking sponge hard explain says
the waterloo canada based startup using algorithms visualize rf fields real time interpret distortions scattered disturbances within these fields are  example disturbance  denoting person pet moving room door window being opened
given increasingly blanketed rf fields idea make use of these signals than sending messages looking pictures cute cats specifically host applications powered device that interpret physical goings an rf coverage area startup wireless signal reader device is called amera
we building platform enables use wireless signals just communications basically core platform says manku platform run bunch applications depending market going after
while existing motion detector technologies  pretty cheap idea amera platform to replace multiple security focused applications  creating value proposition consolidating different features single scalable platform
we positioning replacing motion contacts house add cost of unit actually cheaper says manku
he argues privacy benefits using wireless signals detection medium  unlike security camera  risk  able hack into a live feed interior amera avoids scenario of members family accidentally intentionally spying albeit tech can  used track house device ids instance  used parents tabs kids comings goings
you video surveillance actually looking motion detection sort localizes obviously… people want stick camera bedroom  particular unit intrusive little bit better  does reveal lot says manku
cognitive systems founding te includes chip designers wireless networking firmware dsp wireless standards expertise developed its chipset power platform chip called r contains four wireless receivers and dual multi vector processors with five custom cpu cores it designed  cost effective alternative to hardware startup says would normally cost tens thousands dollars
if look depth technology required  built unit building chip cost   build just buying components says wanted real time  expensive  reason architected chip way architected chip inside processor way enables run applications real time  able deal different wireless standards currently different wireless bands frequencies there
how accurate motion detecting tech depends factors wireless signal emitting devices user home says manku larger homes need hardware units  adequately covered  offer cheaper units expanding coverage amera hub  needed installation
you definitely detect differences volume sort moving regards approximately house property adds actually measure scattered signals  scattered walls  walk change scattering profile we’ll look phase distortion you’ll introduce
for example somebody walking actually change phase rf quite sensitive… number algorithms depending actually happening weighting algorithm sort adjusting certain parameters
the startup is uncloaking stealth today  months tech development discuss product initial market focus security centric applications motion sensing detecting hacking network spoofing attempts raised undisclosed funding  saying region tens millions dollars  investors including quantum valley investments the investment fund led blackberry founder mike lazaridis
we building security type device home businesses enterprise basically does number things  applications localizes motion  able motion motion determined distortion happens wireless field explains manku and applications like device id devices flow devices moving just falls category security
what doing talking platform scalable adds saying look home business enables motion detection  applications start added on… so applications fall unit
manku says initially  selling bb service security company partners resell its hardware packaged with a subscription service marketed at consumers and/or businesses kind notifications user would depend customer facing wrapper security company partner chooses apply
to  clear whichever security firm proving end user service access encryption keys order that they decrypt interpret data generated amera push relevant notifications users  buying amera needs feel comfortable giving potentially companies visibility activity home business network  manku says cognitive systems focused analyzing end user data this initial security market application itself
for security trying protect property happening way tracking anybody encrypt tells techcrunch
manku says cognitive systems looking service running half year says working distribution and security company partners it disclosing names of parties stage initial product launch  the north american market pricing confirmed   cost hardware the subscription service
the wider vision cognitive systems to apply wireless tech multiple ways  example building cloud processing platform called myst which it envisages  used instance power smart city applications ability locate lost child park say (if park question kitted devices generate spectrum map entire region city track people flow  using bit chip hardware makes (a physics engine called x
there markets myst network actually does way processing initial security market application adds manku we markets like network analysis understanding network doing pushing right  people focused…  markets going background
