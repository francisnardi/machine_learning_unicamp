for chip makers pressure produce smaller powerful components generation phones denser faster cheaper  mantras driven industry long people remember
 new game town smartphone era  growth rate slowing key growth driver hardware soon  internet things decade industry churn tens billions connected sensor devices  used corner world  highways arteries  gather new insights help live work better
this chapter reshape technology hardware industry profound ways reverse changes brought smartphone era understand profound shift  important know past markets shaped way computers built
just short decades ago computers filled entire rooms early days manufacturers produced component separately wired circuit board you’d memory board logic processing radio corner wires copper traces connected piece components  easily added removed system
the board configuration worked  computers began shrink scientists engineered smaller smaller transistors transistors like electric switches  fundamental building blocks modern computing
in  gordon moore founder intel famous prediction (misleadingly labeled law   months engineers fit twice transistors particular piece silicon computer components started shrinking fast suddenly lot free space opened circuit boards
engineers soon began experiment putting multiple functions single piece silicon long computer piece silicon wrap nicely market single inclusive package
we chip (soc probably smartphone tight integration components carries big advantages components packed closer signals travel quickly increase processing speed
socs frequently cheaper instead testing components independently run set tests single chip course size matters consolidated package helped manufacturers like apple samsung produce new generations lighter sleeker devices
 big drawback socs manufactured common process platforms large manufacturing facilities called fabs mega factories able produce hundreds millions chips month

the challenge soc paradigm components single chip (processor radio memory locked single manufacturing process does  provide best class component example process platform  excellent processors  just mediocre embedded flash memory difficult upgrade switch components individually upgrading entire fab
for smartphones applications benefits integrated soc generally outweigh drawback emergence new hardware era introduces new set challenges chip makers
let look internet things hardware industry future run billions sensor devices  problem devices exist sorts environments live factories  outside collect data underwater basic functionality smart nodes similar (sense data collect data store data communicate data deployment requirements vary greatly
a sensor node car engine example need withstand high temperatures sensor nodes spread farmland require powerful radio components send data long distances sensors need operate low power consumption (because wo  plugged   important others
even confusing point simply know exact requirements iot applications just early process  start building hardware anyway! presents kinds challenges existing models chip production
the pc smartphone industries able deploy chip designs hundreds millions units giant integrated soc fabs suited  iot different likely consist thousands million unit applications suggest need greater diversity chip configurations we’ve seen date

as result models constructing chips emerging calling developments multi chip modules d package (sip involve packing components closely complete end end integration soc equations governing cost performance power consumption approaches beginning tilt balance away soc favored choice iot smart nodes
in ways great trends pc smartphone eras standardization devices apple great vision understanding people prefer beautiful integrated package need choices hardware  software generally opposite people different needs want select apps programs work best them
in smart connected world sensor requirements vary greatly factory factory mention industries varied agriculture urban planning automotive just like smartphone owners like pick choose apps want iot manufacturers want shop components individually locked single fab
it hard overstate fundamental shift  + billion semiconductor industry grown standardized hardware pcs smartphones  basically boxes live indoors plug walls iot hand require huge diversity hardware offerings ready big changes silicon silicon valley
