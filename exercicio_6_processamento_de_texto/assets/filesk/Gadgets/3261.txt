following year drive cx nvidia just announced updated version computing platform self driving cars drive px  compared year model powerful beast able process data  video cameras sensors real time make educated driving decisions company calls supercomputer size lunchbox
behind scene drive px  features  different cores representing  teraflops calculation power  deep learning tera operations second company using nm architecture hungry beast requires w power finally nvidia using liquid cooling px   used cars problem nvidia argues car manufacturers just plug device existing cooling solutions
nvidia founder ceo jen hsun huang said px  powerful  macbook pros company certainly comparing gpu power  inch macbook pro currently sports intel iris graphics  chip px  features gen tegra processors pascal based gpu total push  teraflops recognize  images second using alexnet neural network based deep learning algorithm

the company announced nvidia drivenet deep neural network equivalent  million neurons trained  million objects far like deep neural networks gets better time
companies  able leverage network  nvidia insisted saying car makers want control neural network
the company promoting platform approach meaning wants work car makers possible kickstart self driving efforts volvo going  partner shipping drive px   upcoming test cars nvidia partnered audi daimler bmw ford develop test px 

as huang showed today keynote power needed enable self driving cars know environment  interpret  safely drive traffic demo nvidia showed new dashboard use data drivers cars given time thanks soon wo need rear view mirrors anymore huang joked
as nvidia clearly noted identifying objects planning basic paths beginning looking ahead making self driving cars work real world means cars recognize circumstances truck  ambulances example better make space those
