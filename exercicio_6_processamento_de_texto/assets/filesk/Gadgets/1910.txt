every year i/o google atap division responsible turning company crazier ideas products organizes small keynote year company offered updates number projects including project soli its attempt building small radar sensor translate hand movements digital signals building new user interfaces wearables
after year i/o demo te focused bringing project developers shipped developer kit  developers year te said encouraged developers used sensor built object recognition tools musical instruments more
the early kit really usable controlled environment used power sensor small did need fully powered desktop laptop run it

that obviously useful te challenged run smartwatch te redesigned chip infineon reduce power consumption  times    w footprint x smaller
radar typically takes lot computational power  new version now x efficient run  frames second
with work te able build soli smartwatch (and time!

this means interact watch touching  use basic gestures interact demo atap te showed scroll messages pretty amazing precision just holding hand watch closer away use virtual dial gesture interact watch face  basically just like use analog watch
the atap te noted means information screen simply account finger covering watch face
the te noted soli just meant smartwatches working harman jbl brand te worked building prototype speakers built soli radar allows control speaker sensor to a distance  meters control speaker distance too

to seed development community atap going launch new beta quality dev kit developers year
sadly unclear we’ll first products project soli technology arrive stores  just like atap worked levi bringing project jacquard smart fabrics market likely soli well
