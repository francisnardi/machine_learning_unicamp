as graphics games movies edge closer closer photorealism subtlest tricks light  simulated years especially tough recreating sparkling uneven surfaces water metals materials   glints  rendered  times faster thanks new technique computer scientists uc san diego

nature course problem rendering light goes  computer perform thousands millions calculations create accurate simulation shortcuts ways fake  real solution
there currently algorithm efficiently render rough appearance real specular surfaces said ucsd ravi ramamoorthi news release highly unusual modern computer graphics scene  rendered given computing power
ramamoorthi colleagues took unusual path computer graphics simulating phenomenon lower level pixel making uneven surfaces considered multitude light reflecting microfacets clever math allows determine microfacets reflect light virtual viewer generalize information  similar microfacets according normal distribution
using position normal distribution technique produces highly accurate representation speculars  renderer spared trouble checking ray light interacts tiny scratch bump far faster well
two samples kind lighting features new technique renders efficiently
