as technology giants accelerate humanity towards driverless car future we are conditioned to keep our eyeballs our devices while algorithms take wheel navigate vagaries open road safety questions crash headlong ethical philosophical considerations

as you’d expect california forefront fueling tech developments dmv currently developing regulations dryly dubs post testing deployment autonomous vehicles  process unsurprisingly given aforementioned complexities lagging far behind schedule draft rules published despite them being slated to arrive at start year
the dmv has just published all official accident reports involving autonomous vehicles tested california roads covering period from last september date website this data pertains google driverless vehicles reports involving mountain view robot cars autonomous vehicle delphi automatic
the reports appear to support google claims human error by the drivers the non autonomous cars surface causing accidents the difficulties caused mingling human robot driving styles in ample evidence
