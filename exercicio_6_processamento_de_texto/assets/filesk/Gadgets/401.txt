we’ve seen d printed cameras   include prefabricated hinge spring complicated bits like shutters iris mechanisms  designer amos dudley i’ve  hoped make camera entirely d printed parts  yes including lens
he used form  sla printer objects using variety resin types  flexible one piece rigid colored one piece clear prints high precision (sub millimeter things like small gear teeth interacting machine parts  produced need lots manual post work knocking pieces sanding down
the enclosure film sprocket iris straightforward  organic look way resin blades slide past other
for shutter dudley rejected common mechanically simple designs solution camera  mirror image planes swoop past shutter button pushed moving blocking aperture position blocking   way clear dudley design end having press shutter button switch way switch set exposure times  works

the amazing lens dudley worked exactly optical qualities he’d need simulating parts distances involved ray tracer actually printed using high quality transparent resin sanded custom machine dip liquid resin fills tiny valleys flaws making lens optically perfect functional spherical problems edges frame  aperture limited factors accounted body camera works!
pop little film (fujicolor superia   ca d print that… ready close ups fixed focus distant one
the rest photos dudley flickr stream
it quite amazing accomplishment hopefully spur similar ideas create similar devices just follow dudley process practice d models specs available here
