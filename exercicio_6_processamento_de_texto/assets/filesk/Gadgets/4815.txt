apple frequently bashed for punch idea way mind works was no shortage of material riff coming of the latest cupertino gearfest week
from that supersized ipad pro (microsoft surface pro got there sooner yo to the tablet cover built keyboard (microsoft surface keyboard cover yo! apple pencil stylus (see er microsoft surface pen lesser degree samsung galaxy note stylus packing phablet range just two of the more recent styli tabs  software  ios new live photos aka photos actually photos  record sound movement (nokia tip back  cinemagraph and living photos generally animated gifs enlivening photos practically dawn internet time… apple voice assistant now having expanded ability be  listening for ‘hey siri’ prompt just devices are plugged power source (motorola launched ‘touchless control’ voice commands moto x handset

pointing that apple is copy cat easy  misses wider point design design design apple informal motto ‘it just works opposite true blackberry storm clickable touchscreen that design snafu brought extra complexity added confusion dated interface likely rim physical keyboard focused designers tried solve problem actually problem touchscreens   clearly problem rim business  just pushing os reset button company really needed to
touchscreens problem apple trying ‘fix touchscreens d touch looking way evolve touchscreens can smoothing small usability wrinkles created mobile users doing much on (relatively small screen  aka forth navigating required because multitasking does room to provide parallel workflows d touch apple focused on improving user workflow by utilizing degrees finger pressure additional time saving navigation layer and it engineered pressure sensitive touchscreen hardware to support this design goal ergo it user focused design tech enabler
even new feature apparently superficial as live photos i’m personally fan (imo photos should most definitely  composed arguably designed specific users/use cases mind parents ios devices invariably taking a portion ‘keep kids entertained’ strain (tc colleagues kids universally thrilled prospect ios photos auto animate it strikes live photos battery friendly way implement animated wallpaper animate user touches user gets personalized look feel (presumably big battery drain
if want bash apple copying microsoft surface undeniably plenty mileage in ipad pro  notable cupertino invited microsoft stage demo software running pro redmond looks pretty flattered flow ideas wider point is apple rarely market new technology phablets basically bringing rear modus operandi speed refining honing testing designing for the flow use users eye mainstre usage can evolve bring new benefits applying technologies become proven or once convinced be genuinely useful why apple took time implementing nfc instance it continues shun wireless charging
and curved screen iphone and chance apple evidently been spending energy developing distinct curveball scramble rivals pressure sensitive touchscreen pane puts far interesting slant on glass slabs few superficial curves (if *actual curved glass* you want you’ll stick lg samsung
if really want criticize apple pertinent focus inconsistencies messaging crying foul ‘copycat tendencies

ditto the live photos recording feature  apparently defaults switched people immediately realize snap a photo new iphone phone is also listening recording toggle accident given icon sits permanently camera view
we believe people fundamental right privacy american people demand constitution demands morality demands said cook his pro encryption speech june going add i’m speaking silicon valley prominent successful companies built businesses lulling customers complacency personal information gobbling learn trying monetize think wrong kind company apple wants be
so apple tell an  siri avoid gobbling users private data you’ll make clear users camera new iphones actually a video camera default (we’ve asked apple comment points update post response
if want really sensitive apple privacy consider pressure sensitive touchscreen provide trove additional personal data for company  given person mood could affect hard soft push on the touchscreen apple  gathering mood sensitive data users apple avoids doing stop third party developers making inferences emotional state users based signals from apple new pressure sensitive pane spanish researchers apparently developed way use machine learning detect mobile users bored based interact content on their phones think the additional intel pressure sensitive screen  used glean…
as lattice technologies surrounds our lives sensitive sensory risks individual privacy are increasing exponentially powerful technology giants like apple act  lead  hugely important dystopic view twitter user put it me this week ‘user privacy individual privacy different things so i one hope apple really thinking different
