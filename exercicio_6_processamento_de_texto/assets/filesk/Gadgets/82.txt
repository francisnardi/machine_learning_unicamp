it quite lovable spherical droid star wars force awakens  robot carnegie mellon university benefit special effect (however cool believe basically moving parts

 robot actually evolution decade old design ralph hollis created ballbot long ago  driven mechanically way worked actually quite easy picture imagine mouse ball  instead ball moving little rollers inside rollers ball

carefully controlling motors lets robot essentially balance ball rolling direction trouble mice rollers wore got dirtied  replaced motors recalibrated
the solution remove ball did mice  remove rollers new version uses induction motor magnetically drives sphere (solid iron copper shell stators way induction motors drive rotor
this reduces wear increases level control ball fewer mechanical forces worry just adjusting voltage magnetic force ball propels want onboard systems upright balanced recover pushed  legged robot  still
the simbot (for spherical induction motor lab bound experiment  omnidirectional motion sophisticated elegant control mechanisms likely source envy robots use legs multiple wheels around
