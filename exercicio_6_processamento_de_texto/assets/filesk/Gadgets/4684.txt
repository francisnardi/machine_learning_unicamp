make way wearable launching sign ups its alpha progr stage today here at techcrunch disrupt sf startup called humon  building a real time lactic acid threshold monitor designed endurance athletes help tailor training to their personal limits
two founders humon met mit mit sloan where the te year been summer accelerator progr  taking in a  equity free grant mit help with product development they’ve bootstrapping development far
so exactly humon wearable targeted at endurance athletes as marathon runners which attaches working muscle  worn quad strap leg hold it place  monitors oxygenated runner blood shining light skin analyzing changes
we’ve iterations prototype says founder alessandro babini discussing current stage development completely wearable measures way muscles use oxygen real time… completely optically  real time blood today feeding data algorithms identify lactic acid threshold
the lactic acid threshold refers point levels lactate created body exercise step significantly rising faster body able clear athletes typically try train lactic acid threshold  avoid risk exhausting overtraining  threshold shift depending level fitness knowing hard train given point  difficult judge
we recommendation athletes scientifically maximum possible performance body sustain says babini product aim when reach certain level exercise lactic acid starts accumulating blood… map evolution threshold so… remove risk hitting wall biggest fears
the wearable uses optical sensor analyze changes the color blood leg representative oxygenated blood  te infers lactic acid levels we can infer exactly kind change optical properties actually change color blood  muscle know exactly oxygen used muscle says
lactic acid created result exercising continued oxygen deficit… kind bookkeeping consumption oxygen time tell lactic acid accumulating
to  clear humon optical approach capable determining exact lactic acid concentrations athlete blood identifying athlete safely push bit harder
we point attempting determine lactic acid levels terms concentration (ie mmol/l adds babini interviewed upwards  endurance athletes vast majority value information requires understand values means important athletes let know hard pushing relative threshold information need train
for example perform interval workouts  threshold long sessions  threshold looking directly way muscle using oxygen believe better insight athletes level effort versus limits body
the idea focus wearable identify the lactic acid threshold came te did market research multiple wearable markets  clearest demand athletes
we looked different markets  icu patients military elderly children athletes got athletic market asked simple question need know body right change life single athletes responded ‘lactic acid’ says babini
he claims currently way athletes measure lactic acid real time  saying instead they typically train on treadmill have pinpricks blood taken times order manually plot lactic acid curve compared cumbersome process a real time non invasive lactic acid measure like a step change
that said humon actually market bsxinsight crowdfunded optical lactic acid threshold monitor is worn athlete calf year tried sweat monitoring wearables way quantify lactic acid non invasive approaches  humon (as you’d expect argues its tech superior  claiming yields the direct real time data that accuracy better measurements sweat
asked specifically humon compares bsxinsight wearable babini claims like like product says latter wearable designed athlete lactic acid curve times year  requires additional inputs such heart rate speed cadence data work  instead giving daily real time feedback te intends humon
athletes want a solution wear daily during training outdoor indoors does need extensive calibration we’ve bought bsxinsight wearable tested talked te think compelling product solves target market problem adds
humon wearable designed to work conjunction app athletes view data real time run phone race it will  able to sync data existing smartwatches garmin and has internal battery plus memory store data syncing later athlete runs bluetooth phone watch
weight wise aiming  g size heart rate monitor according babini price point aiming   planning a subscription model wanting pay extra analytics
because measure way muscles use oxygen really measure true power muscles says babini subscription plan learn lot hard muscles working recover recovery piece extremely important  thinking charging extra subscription information muscle recovery
how big does humon reckon market specialist wearable babini says  extreme semi professional endurance athletes segment is a  million market  expected grow extremely fast years the te longer term goal broaden target from focusing pro segment the amateur fitness space too if look sports wearable market year  billion expected grow  fold years fastest growing markets adds
the te is now looking raise  million investors fund the push of product development  ultimately wearable to the market year think track ship summer year adds babini
humon alpha progr initially available testers boston area  te says will  opened countrywide soon
q&a
q pricinga  priced   compare high end fitbit believe tech game changer initially  beneficial extreme semi pro level   extremely useful amateur market want make available everyone
q production ready unit d printed looks like started month tremendous engineering progress reala started month incorporation date alpha versions look like fits inside gather data try sign website
q sensors therea couple leds detectors different positions kind ip lies
q ‘s volume manufacture pricea low volume  high volume 
q important terms positioned  accuratea i i tell needs  thigh here going work positioning important i just needs  area reliable data quad
q target market percentage people wear heart rate monitors traina roughly   cent  point i saying heart rate status quo today kind indicator measure hand look watch measurement easy make heart rate  today  essentially heart rate data extremely hard leverage performance needs nearly impossible day weather race heart rate going spike completely different levels depending coffee sleep had… point heart rate extremely difficult use order leverage performance rate workout
q measuring oxygenation blood measuring lactic acid kept talking lactic acid…a measuring way muscles use oxygen use muscles deficit oxygen leads production lactic acid exactly bookkeeping consumption oxygen know lactic acid you’ve accumulated  addition lot benefits fact measuring upstre production lactic acid know accumulate unacceptable level happens
q testing  calibrate approach bookkeeping approach talking actual measurement lactic acid peoplea test we’ve house we’ve correlated actual invasive blood test measuring lactic acid measurement muscle oxygenation… doing clinical trials november completely validate  internal validation makes believe accurate
q guys scars testing then…a yeah actually we’ve single finger pricked  times
q does market look like guys ready major releasea extremely lucky going market runners triathletes cyclists strongest communities meet weekend country we’ve seen primary market research talked triathletes runners cyclists   referrals single time
initially want sell direct guys leverage word mouth  hopefully make device  game changer obviously longer term going strong reseller network make available broadly possible
q years road guys going  building lot devices going  single device company think yourselvesa started company sat thought world doing   years mind doubt we’ll  wearing piece technology non invasively monitor body parameters allowing  healthy better shape today steps sleep time pace think world future  stuff like vitamin levels hormone levels lactic acid vision company
q cost manufacturing thesea low level  high level 
q sense works water talked triathletes picture somebody swimminga underwater meant work underwater triathlon completely sweat proof  data underwater accurate  leverageable going pretend make work underwater
q pointed thigh kind provocative concept i lot consumer electronics region  guys got game looks like year years anybody  larger better funded established computer electronics designer actually compete sort position thigh add feature seta hope  better funded company line  talking big companies today apples googles world reason think wo compete right going lifestyle market wearables provide essential insights making piece jewelry steps kind cool wear giving athletes need data achieve goal improve performance win race
