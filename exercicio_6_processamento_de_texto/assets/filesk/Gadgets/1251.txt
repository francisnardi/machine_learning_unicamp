the transportation industry is associated high maintenance costs disasters accidents injuries loss life hundreds thousands people world losing lives car accidents road disasters year according national safety council  people killed  million injured roads alone 
the related costs  including medical expenses wage productivity losses property damage  estimated  billion does account general maintenance repairs costs road highway systems earmark billions dollars public funds year  underfunded
hopefully this problem can  addressed internet things machine learning technologies taking world storm someday  inherent aspect lives
with right implementation iot technology mitigate risks prevent damage reduce costs deployment smart connected sensors combined machine learning powered analytics tools enable gather information make predictions reach decisions make roads safer
the human element continues  main contributing factor road fatalities reckless driving distracted driving dui speeding bad habits increase likelihood road accidents
in country rules regulations enforce safe driving  rules reactive nature force drivers drive safely avoid punishment iot play proactive role helping drivers adopt safe habits
telematics company geotab using iot help fleet management companies significantly reduce accidents autonomous vehicles fully rolled employ technology help manage human factor driving says neil cawse company ceo data collection step telematics know infinite number things vehicle driver doing
telematics onboard diagnostics (obd helping fleet management companies insurance firms collect wealth information vehicles drivers including measurable events speeding seatbelt usage sharp cornering acceleration helps promoting incentivizing safe driving using number measures scorecarding rates drivers based driving data
the second step driver coaching  using data help driver learn drive safer says cawse vehicle driver feedback tools effective way change driver behavior geotab users leverage vehicle reverse detection collision avoidance systems mobile cameras video spoken word notifications detect risks receive live vehicle feedback warnings people safe  major benefit companies looking manage risk control costs related accidents adds cawse
iot telematics reducing overhead ensuring compliance regulations hours service require drivers record details start driving stop important trip details safety measure combats accidents lack sleep cawse explains
in event an accident analysis data collected iot technology help reduce risks future accident data collected telematics  used identify dangerous intersections cities says cawse kind information municipalities departments transportation dollars exactly needed make greatest impact geotab collects  million points data day potential data  used limitless
providing timely maintenance network bridges roads highways country challenging task mismanagement transportation infrastructure leads collapsed bridges potholes roads unwanted congestion fatalities
