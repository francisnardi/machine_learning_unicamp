having spent good deal time flying uavs like dji inspire  phantom  i like consider experienced drones i came horizon hobby vortex  pro racing drone i did think twice labeled experienced pilot i thought i’d hover house snap photos videos
boy i wrong
flying vortex learning fly self stabilizing drones i imagine feels like jump lamborghini after learning drive prius hold left stick second long trees little throttle vortex literally flip mid air
do i’m talking look the footage (much experienced really stretching vortex legs

 i soon learned this crazy sensitivity ability rapidly change direction differentiates multi purpose quadcopter legitimate racing drone
and definitely legitimate racing drone quad weights little pound custom kv brushless motors fly a maximum speed  mph
it integrated fatshark fpv flight c transmit live any  ghz headset  room mound second video recorder (like gopro
software wise drone comes preloaded different tuning configurations maximize performance main things differentiates vortex ready fly drone like phantom each movement requires fine tuning meaning really need know doing fly thing
and tough  good thing considering likely you’ll smash ground really hang things mm thick plate carbon fiber mm thick carbon fiber motor arms
the quad set back  ( you’ll need buy choice controller battery charger fpv goggles separately available now
ultimately vortex probably best choice looking drone automatically avoid trees capture k video generally just impress friends  trying drone racing involved sport definitely check vortex
