what did summer outdoor concerts grilling  did complete room sized  transistor cpu entirely hand did think so
james newman wanted create cpu students use learn computing realized needed use transistors  instead embedding thousands chunk silicon hand wired sized transistors series complex boards created life sized cpu play tetris announced completion project month posted entire build record video geekification
looking like cross abbey road studios epcot center cpu fills room displays output massive led board project took years build flies khz try emulator check entireproject here
computers quite opaque looking impossible work wrote newman i like inside going trouble ca shrink small walk inside silicon chip  way build thing big walk inside leds actually data moving logic happening
the resulting project amazingly complex surprisingly beautiful slowed rose hot dogs whipped soldering irons newman making look bad
