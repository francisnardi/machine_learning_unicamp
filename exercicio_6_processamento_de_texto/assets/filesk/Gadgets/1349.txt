it tough standing increasingly overcrowded world fitness trackers  fair standing pack really atlas wearables‘ issues strange looking thing sort thing enlightened age ubiquitous wearables people look wristband  slight disbelief
it odd looking thing device consists beefy rugged watch strap slot modular device slips and snaps place magnet little modular device measures  x  x  inches  significant size compared smartwatches fitness trackers there

i reached company ceo peter li wearing device bit explained the…unusual dimensions intentional saying iconic wide screen display sets apart ‘portrait’ style devices better viewing longer exercise names probably bit early start calling thing iconic  certainly stands out
and portrait orientation nice reading fair text fly screen quiet long looks first  pretty sizable bezels sides monochrome × pixel pmoled screen limited insofar actually display  plenty sharp

the wristband surprisingly comfortable i wore long stretches just awkward wearable bulky  worn long sleeves  company quick point day wearable unlike fitbits world designed work background degree atlas product meant  broken time break sweat  mah battery reflection fact
as far company opted make product modular li announced  today modularity makes easy swap bands stay tuned that
while looks exactly like version wristband  does feature upgrades predecessor including notably x memory upgrade storing additional exercises manual sync board workout tap button atlas mobile app devices exchange info bluetooth

the atlas wristband compelling idea sure certainly place device goes simple step tracking wrist worn wearables limited usage likely turn casual users  product lacks mainstre appeal makes targeted workouts bevy sensors board capable recognizing slew different workout activities based movements
