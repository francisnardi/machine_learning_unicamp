i’ve seen the basic marketing mistake play best software companies world marketing te needs help engineering update website (publish new posts edit copy upload images set fail 
this mistake executives companies (often engineers unfamiliar day day job marketers website designers developers employ i know software companies hundreds millions billions dollars revenue line marketers simply unable jobs wait engineering days/weeks/months make updates websites 
launching new online campaigns mean waiting engineering te company prioritize working product features create time marketing needs  large scale organizational dysfunction
this insane (making predictable mistake over stop    having debate
in post i want dive deep problem gets created  ignored long marketers (and enlightened startup executives fix it
there reason one marketing investments company building website companies going website print business cards website literally face company  instantly accessible  world internet putting them at strategic center digital marketing effort reason dollars spent websites ( billion digital advertising ( billion 
the website at early startups seen (and built literally extension product  flat html/css deployed code path company core product makes sense te designed built product marketing responsibilities 
 day need grow hire marketers build proper website i know multiple startups > million revenue website updates require new deploy core product means time marketing wants update website copy convince engineering make new deploy
a good marketer obsesses messaging writing branding seo sem analytics code analytics engineers   software engineers (they marketers! requiring marketers learn submit github pull request engineering approval pipeline job taking dogfooding steps far needlessly bottlenecking work making needlessly challenging jobs 
if delay long extreme end marketing te dozens employees ca update control content like work engineering te order deploy code wait line copy editing queue to marketing approve grammar sentence construction code comments 
let engineers code let marketers publish content! marketers ca control content ca job 
simply content management software enables marketers update content websites graphical interface coding pull requests code review  engineering intervention required content management works content management enables marketers job
content management software  years  strangely large ( billion industry recently matured drupal wordpress command  percent share market (going  percent quickly wordpress drupal won market primarily industry professional website designers developers large standardized work software increasingly years professional website developer wo hired marketers unless use drupal wordpress 
most marketers know use tools comfortable using (just ask them! increasingly robust vendor ecosystem (in which pantheon competes specializes operating  hosting scaling tuning developing  wordpress drupal sites  specialized industry tools vendors connected  separate wider software engineering industry i’ve engineers startups pulled website projects but often speed content management industry contributes disconnect
does sound familiar
even convinced marketing needs content management like just snap fingers let real horse trading happens comes managing company website let make sure marketing properly armed because  fair pitting marketer world class engineers weighing technology decision
we ca run wordpress drupal insecure
this lazy excuse true need manage drupal wordpress security updates true software which engineers responsible  like marketer saying ca invest pr result bad pr technically true  wrong nonetheless
it  true engineer want security burden fair  number great options outsourcing responsibility 
my follow question security minded engineering really want run public internet accessible website infrastructure product user data breaking website product improve security security depth
our website developers want use wordpress drupal
this happens borrowing engineers product te develop website engineers build products living familiar tools software engineers  react ruby rails  opposed tools professional website developers use wordpress drupal  especially tricky developers shared product marketing hard ask engineers flip forth different kinds environments
however  fair marketing making implicit trade need sit decide important end engineers use tools prefer marketing te  able manage content decision requires thoughtful weighing trade offs
long term obviously real answer here is marketing resources developing website sooner better  increasingly hard product teams carve time help marketing real jobs course
this flat file website technology i use update personal website way better drupal wordpress use instead i’ll teach make pull request easy!
this pure hubris marketers engineering team are experts evaluating marketing software happen marketer went cto told i went conference saw demo data center management software oracle super powerful i  really concerned missing boat here
if engineer tells marketing executive know evaluate marketing technology better marketer smile politely stay firm (and feel free send post
wordpress drupal overkill engineers going build custom cms work way better
this hubris really stupid  planning spend hundreds thousands dollars (let millions building custom cms fool errand i  understating risk extreme cases (eg digital publishers i seen decision derail companies
what say cto came conclusion order build product needed develop proprietary replacement linux kernel
wordpress drupal huge established open source projects thousands contributors ecosystems hundreds thousands professional developers marketing users vendors terms successful open source projects right linux kernel leveraged hundreds millions dollars open source engineering effort incredibly robust products
your engineering te  talented  going build replacement wordpress drupal overnight going build complicated buggy website money pit marketing department  married indefinitely marketer  job ender 
if engineering te came conclusion need push hard  company afford mistake
we invested current website stack right way prioritize rebuilding right now
this tough high level high stakes prioritization decision company
you need answer company important website i start exercise finding percent leads originate website (for software companies high  percent
you need weigh cost (time money rebuilding website opportunity cost having high functioning website  fair need weigh project risk transition projects  complicated
finally need answer rebuild website weslowly  surely rational business decision making win day
