over past years internet things (iot white hot center flurry activity startups create embedded sensors physical things snapped larger companies rapid pace deals iot startups totaling  billion past years
the iot  big thing  attention sensors misplaced…
what did need embedded sensors allow things gather data surrounding environment material  sensor itself
sentient materials sound like stuff sci fi  quickly reality new generation materials developed sense temperature pressure impact variables  completely removing need sensors
not materials capture relay data cloud reconfigure fly react changing environmental conditions materials just smart  alive  change way things designed used startling ways
how did arrive design engineering used focus materials behaved isotropically  say uniformly predictably isotropic age create design assign material carry specific role design
what allowed materials determine design vice versa nature time seed example works specific environment create tree
this example anisotropic materials action unlike isotropic materials behavior predetermined performance  tailored environment
welcome anisotropic age design
imagine airplane skin self heals remove dings dents maintaining optimal aerodynamics isotropic age that’d  virtually impossible design   anisotropic age  possibility
here work airplane component (like wing composite material coated layer nanosensors coating serves nervous allowing component sense happening  pressure temperature on
when wing nervous senses damage sends signal microspheres uncured material nanocrystal coating signal instructs microspheres release contents damaged area start curing like putting glue crack letting harden
airbus doing important research area university bristol national composites centre moving closer aviation industry shaped smart materials
the automotive industry use smart materials manufacture cars sense damage self heal  collect data performance  fed design engineering process
the hack rod project  brings technology partners te automotive enthusiasts southern california  design car history built smart materials engineered using artificial intelligence
in example paulo gameiro coordinator eu funded harken project r&d manager portuguese automotive textiles supplier borgstena developing prototype seat seatbelt uses smart textiles built sensors detect driver heart breathing rates alert drivers tell tale signs drowsiness
beyond transportation opportunities await construction civil engineering fields smart materials greatly assist structural health monitoring
today world hundreds roads bridges pieces infrastructure slowly falling apart wear tear exposure elements know items need attention urgently
 build structures smart concrete nervous concrete constantly monitor assess status infrastructure initiate self repair soon damage sustained
there major project currently underway massachusetts institute technology (mit called zero+ aims reshape construction industry exactly types advanced composite materials
the researchers mit hard work newly formed advanced functional fabrics america (affoa institute goal come new generation fabrics fibers ability hear sense surroundings communicate store convert energy monitor health control temperature change color

these functional fabrics mean clothes wo necessarily just  clothes anymore  agents health serving noninvasive ways monitor body temperature analyze sweat presence various elements  portable power sources capturing energy outside sources like sun retaining energy  used soldiers adapt different environments quickly efficiently
and accidentally rip hole garment naturally nanosensors fabric engage self repair process patch things  exact way airplane wing smart concrete healed themselves
this hollywood movie  reality clear indicator quickly smart materials coming along
these materials increasingly important role play shaping world us  airplanes infrastructure clothes backs creating things capture data environment  adjust performance based data materials starting play active role design
this potential smart materials keys creating better designed world us
