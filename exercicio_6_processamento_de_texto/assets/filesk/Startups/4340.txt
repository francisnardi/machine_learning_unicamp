we possess ability read future predict high level certainty major cybersecurity incidents  
the world cybersecurity capability able advance line growing vulnerabilities faced more threats day hackers sophisticated organization invests  million or  million in security infrastructure remain vulnerable worse appears end disparity
emerging security solutions great  change overall way things internet favors attacker amazing entrepreneurs established companies creating solutions implement better anomaly detection better network segregation better user identification better leakage prevention simply stepping stones necessary leap forward required long term solution
at time cost securing businesses cyberattacks constantly increasing compounded old technologies replaced new technologies instead new technologies added crowded security infrastructures unless changes come day longer deemed cost effective business wise introduce new services internet
incremental security changes work need disruptive innovation world cybersecurity paradigm shift  change dramatically way things work want solution significant positive effect similar created invention car smartphone time travel
i  going discuss solution now  creating new secure internet dramatically improve cyber resilience time dramatically reduce expenditures cybersecurity welcome world agns (alternative global network understand concept agns 
in  year neil armstrong  man step moon beatles released album abby road packet transmitted small network named advanced research projects agency network known arpanet
trust  concerned small controlled network trust existed arpanet trust real world different users knew connected devices controlled creators network risks fraud hacking malware denial service attacks say extremely improbable
as time went arpanet expanded  technical foundation internet know it
so today billions users know certainly trust connecting sorts devices (we clue connected internet using network way deem fit
trust  challenge
when arpanet project began expected  huge success essential early stages designed security mind  ensure connectivity short time arpanet grew small research network huge global network use today
many modern security challenges experience  attributed fact internet secured design  agreed given opportunity definitely redesign it
and make things worse worse way internet implemented prevents upgrading secure version let explain i mean i say internet  upgraded
we lot innovation internet amazing new applications using new types innovative protocols like voice ip video tunneling  things imagined internet started
nevertheless innovative applications improving core way internet works using problematic tcp/ip stack (more past decades zero probability  replaced years come
why upgrade internet actually upgrade routers switches connected network devices impossible achieve the network devices embedded systems bundled with hardware standard interfaces manufacturer controls software means way remotely access upgrade device
even ipv failed ipv widely implemented ietf published rfc  everybody agreed importance google statistics  percent users access google services doing using ipv
and like place innovation taken backseat problems networking technologies today hard manage inefficient unreliable costly prone manipulations list goes on
billions new devices  connected internet coming years (according gartner time have discussed cybersecurity threats dramatically increase immediate need efficient secure trustworthy innovation friendly (upgradeable internet
though upgrading current internet unfeasible task  way
wireless connectivity technologies kinds (wi fi satellites cellular vastly improved recent years soon reach point commercial companies using small number network devices implement worldwide networks allow internet access  time
two great examples companies that currently working bringing wireless internet connectivity solutions places glo traditional access google facebook  google activities like project loon planning use high altitude balloons facebook activities like internetorg propose use solar powered drones
though daring worldwide wireless internet inevitable simply makes sense spending trillions upgrading super costly physical infrastructures
and lies opportunity
a worldwide wireless internet access solution allow implement new way networking instead using traditional tcp/ip stack based network network necessarily  ip based   built new connectivity model  secure simpler manage efficient
let non tcp/ip global network agn alternative global network
agns introduce numerous opportunities (as numerous challenges  far discuss i write disruptive benefits represent paradigm shift world cybersecurity  created agns
one need new security tools
in world cybersecurity know today new problem (or family problems leads creation new family products new attack vector = new security tools trying emerging threats continue buy new security products
as previously mentioned new emerging solutions represent incremental improvements cybersecurity retain status quo rarely addressing underlying problem create changes necessary overcome threat hackers agns radically change current approach cybersecurity rebalancing power divide internet force good seeking undermine it
the agn architecture design allow agn provider upgrade network operating protocol stack quickly simply obviously creates new innovative opportunities tremendous effect cybersecurity examples
the ability mitigate security risks create new network services breaks paradigm new security risks = procurement new set security tools biggest challenges facing cybersecurity today  solved
two network virtualization
agn benefits include  benefits software defined networking (sdn aim introduce  global scale benefits cost reduction software defined packet forwarding central management familiar sdns i urge learn concept
one important benefits sdn  important benefits agn known simplified virtual management virtual management implemented organizations (through sdns global network benefits leveraged ultimately augmented
virtualization networking similar effect virtualization computing completely revolutionizing paradigm existing coupling hardware software
virtualization means ability simulate hardware platform network devices software device functionality simulated software ability operate like hardware device solution would
with network virtualization network architecture  defined given set devices completely ignoring physical aspects devices actually connect network example home network contain computer laptop mobile phone car family member devices regard world need implement type vpn solution
because the allocation device network determined soft switches (application based switches sit world  connected seamlessly home network possible network architecture defined software physical hardware (as opposed today connections home network possible connected home router
you  able define type network architecture just drawing setting graphical dashboard alternatively  able combine type security solution network using simple drag drop gestures tools include firewalls idss ipss network recording anti ddos virtual appliances
the virtualization networking simplify implementing security tools ciso suspects inside network wants implement new network inspection solution short time just add dashboard click button make traffic network flow new device need define complex routing settings need change vlan acls nor firewalls rules faced problems traditional networks really appreciate change
 fully work we also change way think networks lans wans  wants benefit network virtualization features live principle device connected directly agn agn define logical separation networks
three identified default
the source problems we experience internet today  attributed fact trying supply services require user identification network users anonymous default
the network used e banking services drug purchasing viewing medical results child pornography social networking promoting terrorism
the agn provider  able implement identified default network solution agn authenticate users starting use network  able supply identity service application requires case user  able access bank need type username password
the federated identity approach serviced companies facebook google federated identity means user single identity used different identity management systems
 users  identified hardware devices network interfaces  controlled to improve security trust network
how  achieved
to connect agn buy new type network interface controller (nic supports agn protocols stack (obviously current tcp/ip nics work agns wise designing nic create remotely programmable/upgradeable firmware (to support agn provider ability upgrade agn quickly remotely nic hold unique private key (nicpk key facilitate tunneling devices functioning type license use agn
based nicpks stored nics connected agn agn provider ability create kind network access prevention (nap solution prevent unidentified authorized nic communicating agn device network allocations  determined based devices nicpk example cio define whitelist nicpks allowed access internal resources
and probably important feature using nicpks increasing users accountability internet know today hard exercise accountability hackers malicious entities getting away agn provider change monitor activities entire network provider identify activity aligned network code conduct exercise appropriate sanctions user device
for example user created phishing attack  banned agn network (his account  disabled nicpk  removed whitelist allowed devices user used torrents download movies illegally  banned accessing agn week somebody instigated ddos attack using zombie computers (infected computers remotely controlled hacker users knowledge consent agn provider prevent computers accessing network virus removed
another feature identified default network ability agn provider control protocols websites allowed gives agn provider freedom decide torrents  allowed people allowed use tor like services think creating protocol encapsulation users override agn provider restrictions and eventually create things like agn based darknet
 easy sound major reasons (a centralized network management allows relatively easy deep protocol inspection (b moment agn provider learns new service  able completely eliminate short space time allowing unauthorized services time grow
moving identified design network centralized control high level accountability paradigm shift uncontrolled decentralized internet today
we expect agn providers create native services  accessed agn users agns eventually completely replace old tcp/ip based internet meantime obvious use agns unless access servers services internet   enabled seamless
for happen agn provider implement secure gateway gateway  charge protocol translation (by stripping reconstructing encapsulation safe pass creating agn < > tcp/ip (or internet  internet  gateway retaining high level security agn biggest challenges agn providers endure create alternative internet
it harder harder secure digital assets need disruptive solutions create shift balance things  providing vital lead malicious factors agns do  completely alter approach cybersecurity
some  concerned loss privacy agn world   right  worried agn provider infinite power user  fact does necessarily mean will
many times privacy security opposite forces balancing art science sadly goes privacy monetization designed right agns real positive impact world technology while making users feel comfortable secure
implementation require responsible privacy aware agn provider  misuse power finding balance security privacy centralized control open network monetization fair use challenges face way creating secure agn
to  able create world agns possible need overcome challenges initiate activities
