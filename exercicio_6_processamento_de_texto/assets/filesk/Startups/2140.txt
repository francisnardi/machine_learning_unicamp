more innovation moving firewall meaning invisible public (eg digital d designs reside reach cloud instead local disk drive subject reverse engineering
ironically trend reliance secrecy rational behavior changes patent unintended consequence slowing overall pace innovation trade secrets patents different forms intellectual property play important role comprehensive intellectual property strategy secrecy protects innovation reducing likelihood possess hand patent protection requires publication complete written description patented invention enhancing public knowledge reducing need reinvent wheel
unfortunately recent court decisions have dramatically narrowed eligibility computer implemented inventions patenting result companies developing software centric solutions likely rely heavily trade secrets protect product innovations longer  patented
companies even choose to market innovations way favors trade secret protection delivering innovations services products avoid bringing innovations firewall (eg google search services reveal search algorithms software delivered service
the combination technology market trends recent court decisions patent eligibility altered trade secret patent equilibrium enhancement trade secret protection dtsa helps offset patent contraction innovators likely lead increased focus protecting innovation trade secrets reduction patent applications consequences innovation economy significant
the relative shift reduce innovation sharing likely lead reduced investment technologies currently deemed ineligible patent protection  maintained secrecy commercialized notwithstanding rational behavior government enhance trade secret protection businesses use protection contraction patent undermines innovation economy especially flexible industries
trade secrets patents mutually exclusive   value dtsa improves trade secret protection dtsa place turn attention achieving better innovation ecosystem reversing legislating away recent harmful court patent decisions so we restore proper balance trade secrets patents best promote innovation need both strong trade secret protection strong patent protection going forward
