even refers rising hotbeds innovation world relegates hotbeds working limited domains effectively stifling freedom choice selecting areas opt innovate time ross sings praises silicon valley ‘s influence says lingers continues draw start ups industry sounds lot like elitism dressed garb equal opportunity
a truly level playing field encourage innovators work areas passion preference need skill    use big data ross recommends create new wonderful innovations rival valley world possibilities open reason talented pioneers  able create kind self perpetuating cycle innovation silicon valley built
according piece in harvard business review impact investments  investments allotted companies expected generate positive social environmental returns monetary ones  expected grow current  billion asset value  trillion invested assets decade assets  available emerging nations worldwide help innovators do good while making good
clearly impact investing rise globally  trillion market  huge  assessed represent just  percent global invested assets surely people desire better world invest education impact investing increases investment arena tend understand potential percentage rise higher levels increase
the existing roadblocks encouraging investors allocate larger portion portfolios impact investments world extend assessing actual value existing conscience based investments

the numbers demonstrate silicon valley definitely value player/destination falls far short growth player/destination  critical requirement juncture adequately fulfilled steadily rising class players emerging markets globe
for example china (which features the three largest global ipos of time claim distinction having the largest number female billionaires in world india (which currently produces  million software developers number expected jump  percent  million  surpassing vietn (which  fastest growing markets world going  million  million internet users virtually smartphones  million past  years emerging nation initiative create version silicon valley called saigon silicon city
these nations   distinguishing markets begun emerge decade meaning far silicon king took decades fully ascend tech throne yes king  year head start nations contenders  individually collectively  dethrone currently reigning tech monarch
another example emerging nation making race birth silicon valley is indonesia bandung southeast asian nation largest city capital jakarta  city surabaya sights set making startup friendly place attract tech based companies join ranks impressive list tech startups city home base
a city  million residents (as   percent age  bandung like rest indonesia home highly tech savvy internet  mobile oriented population strategically located country where  percent population use social media  higher rate adoption country earth just among many factors that place city good position win technology game
the city silicon valley project called teknopolis ambitious undertaking supported indonesia tech friendly government project hefty investment capital great deal government support backing it
will succeed silicon valley indonesia ross   say  time tell  does tech centric nation certainly right try innovation outcome particular silicon valley project change fact currently reigning king  way out
it  said original silicon valley  like industry technology empire  reaching end s curve  longer momentum sustain highly coveted upward trajectory believe valley lacks ability engineer make critical shift s curve require maintain ascendancy  importantly external (aka global conditions just happen  right new king  crowned
and just mighty giant goliath fell despite size power brazen self confidence silicon valley arguably passed point return soon  taken despite self aggrandizing confidence swagger smooth innocent looking stones foreign stream
on bloomberg recent list of the world innovative economies ranked  south korea  slots   filled germany sweden japan switzerland respectively
with outranked seven nations simply room global tech landscape silicon valley elitism quashes innovation destroys equality  silicon valley   year olds california waiting opportunity step pull rug innovators world  does mean rest world continue standing letting it
