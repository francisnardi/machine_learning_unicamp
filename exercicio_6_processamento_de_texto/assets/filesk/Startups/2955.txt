there highly divisive costly practice software companies inflicted customers nearly decade practice brings significant emotional duress time investment financial penalties  divert meaningful resources revenue driving activities
and add insult injury practice rewards financial gains perpetrators bad behavior
the practice i refer common software audit conducted trade associations uncover business use unlicensed software prominent software trade groups include bsa the software alliance members include microsoft ado oracle autodesk global heavy hitters software & information industry association (siia hundreds members software media publishing industries
for decade i provided legal defense hundreds clients software compliance audits including companies cited article brave speak i feel coincidence overwhelming majority companies targeted associations small businesses limited technology legal resources
with proliferation devices ease downloads mention unnecessary complexity software license agreements imagine simple  companies unlicensed software use employees knowledge
now let  clear i fully appreciate use unlicensed counterfeit software negative impact revenue subsequent earnings software providers i  certainly defending deliberate use software companies paid
at time i feel i help bring light aggressive shakedown practices associations use expense hardworking companies idea unlicensed software used  happy purchase known
here egregious practices i seen software trade associations use consistently expense businesses country
practice whistleblower payments
software trade associations pay portion settlement money receive report infractions reasonable right really… experience whistleblowers  employees companies accusing person responsible ensuring software license compliance recently departed company
furthermore individuals report non compliance granted anonymity providing disgruntled employee platform taking company complete impunity
in fact currently practice campaign called piracy bsa advertises popular social channels ability whistleblowers receive cash reward dre vacation reporting unlicensed business software
in instance texas automotive repair company fuzzy radiator accused bsa using unlicensed copies microsoft products received letter stating company owe millions dollars alleged infringement bsa notice came soon fuzzy radiator in house person left company
trinda lopez human resources executive company stated initial penalty demand sufficient fuzzy radiator business disputed employee salaries frozen bonuses canceled purchase new equipment abandoned year i think disgruntled employee trying bring company said lopez company sought legal counsel settled small fraction bsa originally sought
lucky roberto comptroller john desch associates inc (jda new jersey based engineering consulting firm specializing accident reconstruction traffic flow management contacted bsa  employees left company  responsible information technology
soon company received certified notification bsa started learn hard way bsa said roberto adding letter received pretty damn intimidating turns person installed software computers question reported company  jda settled bsa mere fraction association sought (financial terms  disclosed settlement agreement emotional damage according roberto extremely significant
practice excessive penalties elicit fear
i think important note  plus cases handled bsa siia company  computers i believe these associations intentionally pursuing smaller companies resources understand proper audit response protocols use fear weapon
the owner based software development company fewer  employees reported similar experience came forward condition anonymity bsa really sly i just trust i think i got target said then added way use local lawyers unconscionable years ago soon employees left company company received official notice lawyer representing microsoft notice claimed they pirating software microsoft office applications operating systems
when informed audit company ran audit software provided bsa checked software use member companies bsa issued demand included penalty excess  company offered remove offending software  told did matter liable software instances recorded audit just kept hounding retaining different lawyers space years said owner small software company
in case bsa audit led visit oracle requested audit  penalty upgraded software luckily documented proof people told upgrade software oracle said ‘too bad just pay up’ said owner adding months haggling i told i court backed down
practice outrageous multiples
in cases software license agreements long complex burdensome bsa publishers force customers pay x software value license penalties require purchase necessary seats penalty
trinda lopez fuzzy radiator adds unfair allowances machines multiple versions office microsoft office suite split component parts increase penalty amount
none companies mentioned software pirates duplication printing equipment mass produce illegal software cases likely victims poor software auditing practices opportunistic employees companies learned experience diligent tracking software related licensing
jda roberto trying  company subject possible future audits mentioned jda prepared  administrative rights removed systems internal audits place regular basis hardest deal employees left malice bsa offered perfect opportunity company trained short evil intent perfectly suited bsa said roberto adds confident whistleblowers subject karmic justice end
