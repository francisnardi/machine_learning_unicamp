as isaac newton wrote i seen standing shoulders giants case tech industry past innovations  cumulative investment developing commercializing innovations provide inspiration platform future innovation
the smartphone owes existence early research eniac ic microprocessor some tech entrepreneurs visceral reaction elizabeth warren assertion did build  tech industry owes enormous debt government early sponsorship predecessor enabling technologies make modern high tech economy possible

the innovations likely  responsible substantial economic growth century include enabling technologies clean efficient energy production personalized medicine in fact government investment basic research expenditure  billion  dollars decade long human genome project commercial subsidies federal state renewable energy tax credits played critical role kick starting industries
while argue cut way long term growth lowering taxes worth noting   innovations described developed marginal federal income tax rates highest earners  highest country history

it worth noting government investment research development renewable energy tax credits subsidies have allegedly target funded organized opposition fossil fuel interests masquerade libertarians (the koch brothers other countries hamstrung ideological opposition clean energy investment in fact china world largest investor renewable energy
the stakes  higher short america long term economic competitiveness stake in opinion choice clear come reinvest growth maintain leadership increasingly competitive global economy  or profits fall behind
