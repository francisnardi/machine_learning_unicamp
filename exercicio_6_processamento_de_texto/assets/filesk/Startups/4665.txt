silicon valley disrupted disruptive innovation clayton christensen happy it
christensen vaulted rock star status tech world  introduced theory disruptive innovation harvard business review (hbr years later published bestselling book innovator dilemma work widely praised including glowing endorsements malcolm gladwell michael bloomberg steve jobs rightly concept disruptive innovation hugely important breakthrough understanding major innovations succeed
yet decades christensen published original article idea disruptive innovation achieved meme like status silicon valley  and lost original meaning process today disruption used justify innovation coming tech sector
dismayed misuse work christensen recently wrote reply critics titled disruptive innovation given overuse disruption endured years article (co authored michael e raynor rory mcdonald needed reset theory disruptive innovation  applied  be
to prove point christensen uses uber example suggests uber innovative disruptive innovation instead sustaining innovation meaning uber represents incremental improvement existing taxi industry
that christensen gets wrong wrong way instructive unfortunately common misunderstands platform businesses like uber (and apple we’ll second work
according christensen theory disruptive business originate low end market upstre higher value markets create new market foothold meaning creates new market existed
a disruptive innovation definition starts footholds christensen says according hbr article uber does meet criteria  wrong counts
first uber clearly took low market foothold
uber started platform demand black car services sustaining innovation higher end black cab limousine market uber essentially new interface existing market
in hbr piece christensen places lot emphasis uber originated emphasis consistently applied examples uses previous work  hitachi sony quantum corporation  number companies introduced products christensen cited work examples disruptive innovation products likewise apple christensen mentions recent hbr piece did start iphone
in light unfair apply restriction way dismiss uber given startup did truly  start compete regular taxis  introduced uberx
uberx christensen ignores piece classic low end market disruption taxis tightly regulated drivers face strict requirements cities drivers obtain special operator license medallion order act taxi there also restrictions cars drive
in contrast uberx started market traditional taxis allowing  car drive people money special knowledge certification required
as result uberx initially competitive taxis passengers uberx cost taxi took long time arrive drivers required extensive knowledge navigate city uberx lacked safety precautions regulations traditional taxis used protect drivers passengers (uberx eventually added  safe ride fee improve safety standards short quality uberx lower traditional taxis
however uber network grew city ride costs fell wait times declined rating helped driver quality relatively consistent improvement service quality uber able upstre attack taxis directly uberx  classic disruptive move
in new york city shift happened obviously summer  time uber launched nearly ubiquitous marketing campaign city ads declared uberx rides cheaper taxis today major cities uberx cheaper faster better quality taxi   true service took catch grow network
this progression perfectly line christensen original disruption theory disruptive innovations catch mainstre customers quality catches standards says recent hbr article uberx started low market foothold moved upstre disrupt taxi market uberx improved quality did catch mainstre consumers
so uber started market moved upstre clear example low end market disruption let uber qualifies new market foothold
christensen added idea new market footholds original theory explain apple success multiple times decade christensen declared pessimism prospects apple products including iphone example  told bloomberg businessweek prediction theory  apple wo succeed iphone adding history speaks pretty loudly widely criticized tech blogosphere getting wrong
now apple iphone disruptive original sense christensen misses launched iphone shorter battery life used way data secure blackberry leading smartphone device
by traditional industry metrics iphone worse product blackberry fact initial reaction blackberry ceos jim balsillie mike lazaridis announcement iphone want it inferior product
the blackberry primarily enterprise product apple started market consumers moving upstre enterprise market iphone popularity forced employers create bring device (byod policy allowed employees use smartphone wanted example classic low end disruption
however attempt improve disruption theory account apple christensen added concept new market footholds hbr piece uses iphone example type disruption building entirely new market connected app developers iphone owners apple built platform disrupted smartphone industry christensen right  compares uber apple way demonstrate iphone disruptive uber not
yet hinted earlier uber clearly created new market transportation uberx uberx allows  car license drive car hire unlocked entirely new source supply created new market hire transportation brought market consumers who regularly use traditional taxis cities market uber created times size original taxi market new market disruption action
uber plainly meet both criteria for christensen disruptive innovation theory does wrong
looking origin disruption theory companies christensen continues wrong clear pattern
the theory applies old school product services businesses  linear businesses because defined linear supply chain value information flow primarily direction (from supplier consumer
it surprising theory works linear businesses originally based christensen research shifts linear companies disk drive manufacturers steel mills all the businesses original hbr article books linear businesses well
 comes platform businesses like uber apple disruption theory breaks down
this platforms operate different way linear businesses building refining supply chain platform creates grows network network platform harnesses supply  think uber drivers iphone app developers words platform does control supply way linear business does
why does difference matter christensen theory looks customers ignores supply words author michael raynor theory disruptive innovation demand theory customer dependence competitive reaction product markets supply theory…whether uber following disruptive path success function customers serves emphasis added christensen company exclude uber based distinction
while approach worked linear businesses applying uber shows misunderstanding platforms work linear businesses supply typically distinct customer group people (or businesses sell products
 platform businesses different platform distinct customer groups consumers producers
uber excellent case point company expends considerable resources market potential drivers retain existing ones uber different linear businesses which disruption theory based platform like uber producers customer group too
christensen hints difference use apple example  does apply equally uber building facilitated network connecting application developers phone users apple changed game christensen says
in words reasons apple disruptive added second customer group app developers true uber drivers treating examples equivalent changing traditional linear supply chain  christensen does uber  shows lack understanding platform businesses work
the difference linear platform businesses important implications look disruptive competitors
uber started black cabs adding uberx disrupting taxi market snapchat started peer peer messaging adding stories content platform starting compete traditional content advertising outlets
there examples including airbnb alibaba etsy facebook google instagr pinterest wechat youtube
once platform established strong network original core transaction easily tap network unlock new customer groups create new markets networks extensible way traditional supply chains not
in fact platforms create new markets succeed building sustaining innovations  introducing disruptive innovations build new networks communities marketplaces
going christensen theory accounting nuances platforms work successful platforms disruptive surprising given usually entirely new business model replacing old linear one
 does mean theory disruptive innovation time update account platforms
to maintain usefulness theory disruptive innovation needs account differences linear platform businesses especially because platforms dominant business model st century we suggest using term platform disruption clarify distinction original theory
as uber did platform shift network industry introduce new disruptive innovation platform disrupt seemingly unrelated industries google did android building new transactions off its existing network ability shift industries means platform does disruptive today suddenly  disruptive competitor tomorrow
and unlike disruptive linear businesses typically attack weaker competitive position platforms position competitive strength words businesses far dangerous existing competitors original theory disruptive innovation suggests
