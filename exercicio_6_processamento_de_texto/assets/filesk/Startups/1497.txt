i recently asked investor some seo advice (because run bc companies came opinions till seo i thanked linkedin a hours later seo consultant offered input curiously recommendation profile investor
eventually got business did sell was more expertise giver getter conversation par investor earned goodwill consultant i actively contribute deal flow small way asking  i  prospecting him
do happened seo consultant did engineer way conversation instead used fact investor common connection gathered status i’m market seo services took advantage insight reached right time
today data available bring people similar adjacent profiles closer inform signals contexts help pay forward seek help period time community (a micro market network form prospect   job deal or funding
ergo replace awkward sales overtures touch points precisely planned deep understanding extended network
we need sophisticated tools just help fake way conversations using data points  truly connect customers and hiring managers people ideas causes common
sounds like linkedin right wrong
they resumes motivations
today professional networks resume graph (to  flattering prospect graph not people economic motivation graph (the graph plots give/get instincts time different contexts
in absence awareness motivations interests people simply connect ask favors sell face accept connection invites anymore!
they connections relationships
in network friction connect connections  superficial connected we share common principles background traits
un nurtured connections turn cold  useless connectors ultimate prospect result you’d resort smarmy sales tactics intro common connection
they treat product ready open wallet
highly networked professionals (entrepreneurs way track personal network signals come manner act catalog future use abundant data social networks like facebook twitter linkedin whatsapp email offline conversations  packaged insights prod reach people important us
example linkedin facebook know i  connected certain ceo saas company organizing saas conference   network thinks important notify ask ping ceo/conference organizer ask needs help real opportunity help strengthen relationship lost
the circle google+ created groups linkedin facebook designed did/continue underwhelming job surfacing contexts professional networking degrees professional acquaintances context reason  touch lost touch resort cold methods reaching time need network vast  utility minimal designed take advantage of context
they engineering serendipitous conversations
professionals react help requests ask tips information help ad hoc manner networks ask just inertia asker creates friction ask network time networks good job parsing person connections suggest subset target broadcast given context
the nudge ask nudge to  explicitly designed till habit forms
the absence truly valuable professional network  participants (users like i gain customers (recruiters sales reps points fact simple professional network pragmatic design think reinventing outreach
a professional network valuable ease access i user real identities and network profiles connections i need know i  connected care needs wants giver taker professional networks acknowledge fact giving taking essentially commerce paid social currency pre pay (karma pay forward post pay (i owe practice world selling
networks ignore intent connections subvert natural urge commerce  materially important networks (to quote words of wall street linkedin purpose outreach relationship building
come think designed professional network  true market network professionals engage meaningfully clear understanding profile transact primarily help professional contexts
unlike general professional network professional market network organize interests backgrounds (micro networks users enable transact merely used sources data  gross utilization value network participants
with network outreach  focused curated  making better experience involved
