over past  years i’ve cap tables startups i’ve responsible closing capital raising efforts i’ve in over  investor meetings operating te raised money smallest angel investor biggest european vc funds and some world largest corporate investors
my present role head corporate development founders factory has me table assessing materials pitches early stage startups running internal founders factory progr designed assist cohort close round financing
i remember managing director jim meyerle coming pitch days attends wild eye mimic particular startup presentation asked syncopated emphasis imagine world pizza true i ca reason invest  point jim making
at founders factory hire actors help cohort present prescri rigid formula pitch function type accelerator we fewer cohort members provide bespoke progr point principle
 complaint pitch demo days cookie cutter approach pitch approach led presenting teams delivering inauthentic damaging caricature product
new founders ravenous seekers knowledge  demand guidance generally equivocal received  truth equivalence rule comes early stage tech investing particularly pre series stage reason easy intuit success early stage tech business sufficiently complex predict super forecasters require systems certain level maturity confidently predict   months
very early stage technology businesses stage success certainly matter irreducible uncertainty winners sit taleb fat tail  means best investors able deploy way data guide decision instead say make decisions intangibles feeling te sub text story speaks urgency innovation size opportunity sense big mo
the challenge  opportunity  intangibles entirely subjective like barthesian death salience sales message ear beholder
and know decision likely level unconscious fast processing associative  kahnemann   and later justified slower apparently rational  simply self certifying … throw ironies like good pitch alienating investor presenter focused honing pitching skills point precision forgetting pitching really pitching  sales  sales subtle failed job selling
so collapse completely nihilism guidance early stage pitch help cohort understand speaking listener  deliver narrative coherent story follows dramatic arc must ping emotional senses spark fall love
they need believe know talking today  able credibly navigate uncertain  potentially industry altering future need believe inspire employees partners investors need trust storytelling plays significant makes product available believable done your product investor materials need  sufficiently robust allow apparently logical  confirm bias you
we encourage you to think investor deck terms story

you need know works investor work subjectivity entirely natural utterly unavoidable  rejected some
therefore allow offer canonical pieces advice comes pitching
 custodians magic
very early stage tech investors nature embracers future they’d  like charlie munger waiting watching for months years investing  they’d wrung decision mental models make sure corrupted bias
very early stage tech investors want  shocked impressed equal measure want tell know want demonstrate insight study and/or experience and/or flat genius just bloody bone crushingly smart want believe  precisely just  deliver promise want magic want  custodian it
your job convince this
i recall gerard archie founders vidsy managed change mind just way blush i vidsy interesting upwork… creator marketplace  said things i knew ( hindsight obvious  best kind insight likely know
firstly branded video advertising newest social platforms jarringly anachronistic totally tone deaf incumbent creators creating content sufficiently lithe speak constantly shifting consumer zeitgeist face swap filters time lapses chewbacca masks second archie digital film graduate knew there swarm young creatives time energy desire spin volumes high quality platform consistent content
the te uniquely lived sides marketplace helped understand spin product natural thing world provide solution
the guys building flourish product spent years data visualization agency creating jaw dropping interactives example animate world planes ships squish countries compare given metric  rub duncan published author best selling books climate change belt robin oxford educated computer science phd flu laid couch finds proofs n p quite hard math problems
they hard won insight born real world experience particular way structure responsive interactive visuals designed tell stories data years honed approach felt ready make tool kit let  product specifically telling stories bit does exist today i did know understood democratizing skills bigger powerful idea hoarding them
practice wild
this single best piece advice i read tons articles like internet ask mentors thousand questions (and probably receive thousand different answers pitch
 i’ll repeat pitching pitching  sales sales subtle is about convincing human beings buy something
you raising weeks months  convincing people life pitching like skills better delivered coming  approach   just driving riding bike playing virtuoso violin pre frontal cortex way cause yips instead rely primitive brain systems optimal processes trial error feedback tweaking original lean methodology
through repeated practice sophisticated subconscious work effective rhythm pace presentation adapt questions react investor said cues like good comedian guess audience  receptive  wo know tried tweak tweak best  naturally flows
the homunculus believes  control actually performing confident energy guzzling sabotaging imp best deployed really needed
so practice practice practice  and watch fall place
like magic
