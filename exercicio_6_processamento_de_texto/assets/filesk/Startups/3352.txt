they say you’ve frostbite forget cold founder suffered bad board board member forgets either
i took company public age  board i trusted people taught meaning word acrimony i obsessed helping founders pick right board members avoid mistakes
here looks like me
trust absolute journey startup public easily decade things wrong things hard hard decisions need trust people table trust input
trust particularly critical worst case scenario founders survive ceos survive  trust respect knew believed required good company  happy  you’ll eventually you’ll carry chip shoulder rest life
i point angry outed founders successful companies  i’m sure know angry believe trusted respected people pushed out
respect simple term complex set realities  enumerated point people are
smart wise
not just other iq hardware born wisdom software run it humans earn software time experience
one classic mistake founders make need people running software you packing board copies buy mirror tape recorder look people experience  advanced version code running  likely better people experiences entirely void weak in
open minded
intelligence wisdom  useful  convinced know known static things change past preamble  willing new version present future
my significant pain board came people prior world metaphors trying constantly apply new world business  insisting right greatest value came person  open new world look like open wrong creativity  brain engineering centric founders bring table good bit board
willing help
often promised seldom delivered likely worse  seed investors i seen companies rounds comes investor defines hands  way saying lazy disengaged
i respect people roll sleeves needed work impact i recently helped founders win minute slot major european pitch competition  able attend did  send lose slot i cancelled week meetings flew conference pitch won btw telling won bragging rest just explaining  par  i learned birdie
one interesting dichotomy i noticed venture dual fiduciary responsibilities board members company firm delicate appropriate balance  manages wins biggest company wins biggest driven mission tend  focused making best decisions
this does mean entrepreneur  wins want best tough love role parental fraternal typically saying yes  helping make best possible decisions means letting entrepreneur having heard input idea forward idea committed believe right vision board lacks preventing mistake
a founder i was advising told meaningful pivot considering business going exceptionally idea clearly company killer help founder danger i spent hour telling stories mistakes i did work i told decision kill company thanked advice did anyway
i remember things painful decade investor watching founder drive cliff able grab wheel decision did kill company i board  board prevented mistake
this function generally sum previously covered attributes people committed business business day trees forest daily woodsmen not
i’ve epiphanies meaningful impact founder business seeing importance new trend far ahead embrace having experience i share helps make make decision i love board member comes idea blue truly aha moment come patterns recognize time  come ether
avoiding bad advice equally important founder told investor took brand reasons he’d learned advice just useful harmful time i listen advice i regret said
as seed investor i encouraged founders consider investors advice opinions make decision  need consider advice stems from  experience valuable opinion questionable founders know ship sailing crew  reason hit rocks sailor
i recall founder liked board member personally  considered dangerous investor concerned looked board members firm making hard calls
i board member boards cost enormous wasted time period months going formal process internally  reason i glean need make sure firm questioned later issues self confidence
if board member self confident  ca firm support critical decisions problem standing firm final point…
this really person  firm they financial resources distance
any active tier firm fulfill need  things change i recall company doing needed round raise  board member firm able raise fund limited reserves reality mix inadequate dose lot drag funding round
the entrepreneurial journey long hard seven  years  expected  long time spend human does meet criteria but came just right firm i mistake know experience  firm grow fade  you’ll  working person long time good times bad yes choose quality firms  pick best man woman journey
