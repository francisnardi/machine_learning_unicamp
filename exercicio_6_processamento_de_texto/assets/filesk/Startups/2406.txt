it important appreciate just prescient andreessen idea  time internet was pervasive amazon decade iphone years old app store was three years old doing  billion revenue millions developers facebook  million users netflix streaming  billion hours content quarter people said we finally fully immersed technology era internet changed words future here
and marc predicted wrong it
six decades computer revolution decades invention microprocessor decades rise modern internet technology required transform industries software finally works  widely delivered global scale
uber founded  launched service  outside small  loyal community riders local airport limo drivers san francisco people knew uber  participating endless conversations about uber x similarly airbedandbreakfastcom (later  renamed airbnb founded   reached  million listings  today hard imagine getting busy cities services
what uber airbnb  like andreessen  understood software eating world incredible innovations emerge just moments looks like changed we’ve reached new normal uber airbnb saw world cloud iphone app store aws google maps said  better simply possible today discontinuous leap  supported rise new platforms  led company dismantling transportation industry reimagining hospitality
netflix  far startup   interesting case started shipping dvds people homes people watch movies having live hassle making trip blockbuster evolved providing streaming movies comfort people homes
like uber airbnb netflix looked platforms infrastructure available (first usps broadband internet asked platforms thought (shipping dvds previously unfeasible  took discontinuous leap technology provider service content creator
now think far movie studio like hbo creates original programming albeit vast unique understanding viewing behavior derived analytics subscriber base

this recurring pattern innovation smart players necessarily build entire vision future look around for inspiration problems solve people (getting ride finding place stay killing time leverage platforms available to come problem entirely new way
sometimes like netflix process incremental (or ben thompson characterize ladder times infrastructure place dramatic discontinuous shift

uber leaves specialists focus elements respective core businesses uber instead focuses curating world class experience customers solving problem transportation masses ride time
this laser focus allows energy main problem trying solve rely specialists essential aspects critical app  qualify areas uber needs strategically build core competency benefit approach getting initial application built  freeing resources ongoing maintenance non core elements stack
