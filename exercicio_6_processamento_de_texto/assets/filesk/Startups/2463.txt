in return jedi yoda tells luke start dark path forever dominate destiny consume will
luckily did apply patent world i spent seven years dark working patent trolls coming light patent trolls companies derive revenue asserting patents other companies
my experiences dark profoundly shaped view role patent assertion entities (paes patent trolls play tech industry struggle paes companies produce sell products stark binary light dark good evil  fact remains pae litigation does harm good
the tech industry fertile ground pae litigation patents plentiful companies increasing global reliance technology paes incentive stop unless tech work stand them
when i started law firms i represented clients sides patent ecosystem intel i spent seven years defending company patent claims operating companies trolls dealing product companies intel high tech companies use patents defend balance demands aggressor
one big issues trolls reciprocal liability vulnerability patents allows trolls  aggressive operate near impunity product company use offset exposure troll patents
after seven exhausting years dealing aggressive threats litigation demands fast payment perpetual bearer bad (and expensive news senior management i ready change i joined rambus company reputation aggressively asserting patents computer memory
as vp licensing rambus i line patent assertion engagement company ran years rambus i joined intellectual ventures (iv world largest patent licensing company licensing executive i line patent licensing engagements iv considered  silicon valley hated troll patron saint sorts inventors
after a couple years iv i had working pae relieved onslaught patent licensing demands constant threats litigation i experienced intel new sources stress troll side
first patent licensing income generating engine company constant tremendous pressure bring money cheaply quickly possible zero sum game paes looking maximize revenue target company wants minimize costs love lost troll side
 i felt i able maintain professional integrity natural inclination target company avoid long possible and get away quickly possible seven years troll life i decision return corporate world work company actually makes things helps push technology industry forward i joined lenovo vice president intellectual property
while i eager leave time dark valuable yielded insight nuance paes operate negative impact  them
the sad reality patents used trolls need  good iv pae make money quality issue costs   million patent claim merit settling costs just   million trolls aggressively push extortionate settlements far surpass value ip know many companies choose settle embroiled expensive drawn lawsuit actions wreak havoc tech companies sizes
a study boston university estimates patent litigation destroys  billion firm wealth year does factor ancillary effects curbed innovation decreased amounts venture investing
that said working paes did help appreciate certain arguments favor iv argues did buy patents inventors paid creating capital market invention claims help revitalize inefficient companies make innovation profitable turbocharge technological progress
in theory validity argument true individual inventors smaller companies  compensated inventions  reality harm businesses suffer significantly outweighed harm caused exorbitant costs patent litigation lawsuits settlements iv gains tens thousands patents vastly proportion value innovation licensed
it abundantly clear paes net detrimental business innovation despite say trolls making world better place  time lay arms allow companies use patent way intended
patent trolling lucrative chances paes forsake greater good slim legitimate businesses responsibility to tech industry try to minimize activity larger resourced corporations like lenovo can mean purchasing strong patent portfolios  available paes essentially use patents weapons fewer patents better
a company set corporate policy prohibits selling patents trolls important  percent patents litigated paes acquired operating companies
lenovo believes strongly protecting innovation having seen real threats trolls pose i pushed join lot network non profit community companies work minimize exposure patents owned trolls fellow members like red hat canon logitech subaru making real dent pool patents  useful paes count nearly half million patent assets protected used weapons pae litigation members of lot network
as spent time sides i feel speak frivolous overpriced patent litigation work i did paes corporations certainly legal  i  right law i prefer right innovation
companies want create technologies matter years patents continue matter frivolous lawsuits demanding damages far excess value allegedly infringed patent detract ability push innovation better products forward i hope voices tech join decrying harmful effects needless patent litigation  future depends it
