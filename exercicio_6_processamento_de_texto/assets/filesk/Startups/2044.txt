the technology industry specifically internet continues  standardized isolating makes harder new players edge new railroad wars fought major players largely defined type definition good bad ease use software relationship hardware better understood  fewer blue screens death
also shift mobile world understood industries consumers aside older generations comfortable technology longer exclusive hobby community nerds
not standardization good we’ve seen shift handful companies controlling  percent pie ability innovate increasingly difficult
how long taken come new car company time saw new computer company shape really want hammer nail coffin time rode amtrak arrived time innovation hard getting harder software saturates market expense focus hardware
in recent years biggest change come apple  know smartphone gone blackberry  well… let save article notable movements past  years  biggest far away introduction iphone apple forced google hand game   apps dominated venture capital programmers  rock stars consumers amazingly satiated
 look closer really happened past years huge app fatigue platitudes connected home wearables vr bots recently live video surfaced hopefully  big companies creating hope hype hungry consumer hungry new hardware long big movement
we teased apple watch nest dropc got close  potentially faded recent focus pure software play interesting  new
the big companies forced innovate  innovation scale hard current type innovation happening feels cheap bit trivial bots cool does  really care we’ve building bots years hyped live video interesting  incremental step companies like facebook new hardware
the magic comes marrying new hardware software  think tesla iphone ipod aws beats headphones roomba just few i mean white label software controlling bad generic hardware i mean end end thoughtful solution built single purpose mind roof
we need shift thinking clouds clients think holistically majority innovation past  years startup space software i believe time entrepreneurs think differently structurally innovation continue pace
we need to time building software hardware  modified cohesive model need learnings early days bring future new software coupled new modern hardware provides broader relationship consumer product
the challenges different building software hardware cohesively know companies low level programming hardware level different craft consumer facing fancy graphical interface development
this newer style development requires understanding functionally different thinkers play nicely apple versus microsoft tesla versus ford nest versus samsung generally requires money started  impressive raspberry pi building prototypes playground friendlier
smaller companies owning end end experience disruption investment come i’m spending lot thinking time entrepreneurs i deeply admire thinking areas evolve
here thoughts home router wide open designed router coupled innovative ip enabling new sharing capabilities wi fi prime i believe room new type computer company company focused forked version chromium sophisticated ad driven business model
furthermore big opportunity pre smartphone device children device communicating location parents acting digital allowance basic communication platform chosen friends
to ideas truly work means considering owning entire experience just software again fundamental shift majority time spent
have reached software saturation sectors yes are markets reacting of this yes best products learnings recent years evolve single impactful experience consumer
the companies best open totally new revenue streams  far defined era app  money  made
