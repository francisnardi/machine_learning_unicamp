the uk embraced equity crowdfunding  innovative finance generally thriving industry benefitting small businesses investors economy alike
the united states hand gotten bogged strictures outdated regulatory lagging far  likely continue so
much difference british american approaches innovative finance  attributed history respective regulatory systems
when stock market crashed  lot ordinary americans lost lot money s seen swathes retail investors enter capital markets little information investing investments sold door door rarely risks investing clear 
so share prices fell ordinary investors caught surprise  invested far money afford losing homes livelihoods
the government responded enacting world truly comprehensive financial regulation designed large protect ordinary people investing understanding means designed way investments bought sold  relative lack communication investor sophistication  s s
and lawmakers time did contemplate things change built rules based meaning investment transactions governed detailed sets rules covering nearly aspect conduct limited modifications rules based remains force today
the  market crash affected britain  different way uk europe investing days preserve institutions small group connected wealthy individuals ordinary people money stock market did lose great impetus change laws protect british financial sector remain relatively self governing limited legislative intervention decades
it s sufficiently large base retail investors emerged uk government felt a comprehensive financial regulation needed result financial services markets act  (fsma remains governing piece legislation today 
by time fsma enacted internet mass use importantly clear ways investments transacted business general conducted evolving technology likely create changes years come
so fsma designed flexibility adapt changes market  sort future proofing instead american rules based approach fsma adopted significantly principles based approach financial services firms expected abide key sets principles investor protection ( things  given significant discretion exactly did so 
the evolution innovative finance atlantic  understood lens regulatory systems
a principles based approach  destined  accommodating innovation new areas finance emerge existing principles limited change actual laws say free uk regulator (the financial conduct authority fca need sign new models authorization firms conducting  significantly simpler flexible process trying new law passed  exactly required innovation happen united states

but what did care regardless rich invested loads actually understood risks sort investment created quiz investors pass online multiple choice quiz showing understood key risks considerations investing asset class
we presented quiz fca authorization process indicated they thought approach sense got approval rest history
now consider american approach law principle making sure investors understand risks instead bright line rule says unless investor wealthy (exceeding specified income net worth tests limited exceptions  offered shares private companies exercise judgment flexibility regulator (the securities exchange commission sec make case case call 
as result equity crowdfunding  possible things happening congress need pass president need sign sec need implement it
remarkably happened relatively quickly bipartisan groundswell support equity crowdfunding emerged roughly seven months   piece legislation houses congress president desk signature
 thirds way got regulator implementation stalled sec supposed finalize process december   end missed target nearly years adopting necessary implementation rules october   (and effect  
 story does not end original legislation passed in  lot flaws  flaws  significantly evident european platforms have grown people come better understand equity crowdfunding works practice
the sec cognizant flaws (and think that delayed implementation long  powerless change new piece legislation  needed fix them

the story equity crowdfunding just example different regulatory systems pond fostered different cultures innovation finance similar types issues  seen range financial services fintech sectors
so hope lost financial innovation united states not congressman mchenry house majority leader kevin mccarthy recently launched calling innovation initiative initiative include series proposals designed make easier american entrepreneurs create fintech ventures in particular serve needs small businesses ordinary individuals
it early days  encouraging sign leaders woken increasing deficit united states faces space relative britain fitting congressman mchenry announced innovation initiative event washington dedicated discussing britain lead america fintech space
 i support innovation initiative does fix fundamental problem innovation  faster legislative processes financial regulation requires new statute time innovation emerges  able up
until  unless  the united states builds level future proofing financial regulation  principles based regime like uk way  britain lead united states innovative finance continue grow
