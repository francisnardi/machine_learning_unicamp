placemeter helps businesses municipalities measure happening stores streets parks
in iteration service relies real time video feeds able quantify overall number objects saw distinguish pedestrians vehicles
now service getting significantly smarter default placemeter distinguish different objects people bicycles motorcycles cars large vehicles (think trucks delivery vans etc
traditionally way cities measured traffic simply placing meters bike paths streets passed measured bike vehicle  able far granular accurate count real time
the placemeter te piloted project city paris collaboration cisco specifically city paris wanted data redesigning public plaza
initially just counting unclassified objects  realized quickly wanted understand granularly exactly passing space understand bicycle lane versus pedestrian benches placemeter ceo founder alex winter told me nothing outside computer vision level granularity

 
working city paris placemeter adapted model count swimmers public pool
as winter explained te decided use traditional computer vision approach instead using deep learning to classify objects need  able quickly learn categories constraint training millions data points told me while currently recognizes different object types te hopes expand   time te noted tweak algorithms different locations specifically train recognize certain scooter car shapes japan example

placemeter offers three pricing plans users pay  month camera basic analytics single object class  month object classes (pedestrians vehicles access classes pay  month long run te plans bring dozen classes  plan   one
