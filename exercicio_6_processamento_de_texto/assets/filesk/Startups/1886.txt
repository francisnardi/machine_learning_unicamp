startups like warby parker bonobos casper proven possible build modern brand predominately using digital tools result flood early stage tech vcs barged market like walmart shoppers black friday
andy dunn bonobos recently christened class company digitally native vertical brands dnvbs basic definition dnvb brand born primarily experienced internet features vertically oriented business model combines margin retailer brand great definition warby x phenomena
many companies far surpassed typical growth expectations cpg company we’ve seen dnvbs reach  million sales couple years variety categories  eyeglasses razors mattresses food just brands need respect certain set irrefutable laws retail physics exit caps modest multiples price erosion face slowing growth increasing competition
i founders negotiating huge funding rounds eye popping valuations taking time ask valuation entails founders signing term sheets implicitly require  leader industry wide margin justify price smart founders cognizant reality price conservatively raise capital consistent likely exits
this key reality founders need internalize buyers old line cpg markets tend make splashy acquisitions  hear coach buying new handbag line  billion stock market does reward big acquisitions categories silicon valley giants expected justify purchases partially financials massively constrains realm possible outcomes
for instance largest company space market cap  billion  impossible pay  billion buy competitor  million stretch  million  startups price price range virtually pre revenue acquisitions markets founders handwave past vcs  acquirers  focused gross profitability grand visions
there money  categories  overly financed businesses fail yield return investors employees founders consider big cpg brands decade largely bootstrapped chobani
big exits harder come consider average exit multiple branded company e commerce generally great
take company like thinkgeek e commerce company sold tchotchkes nerds based licensed properties like star wars minecraft designed sourced products stretch say company dnvb geek culture ultimately acquired  million gamestop sounds like great win niche e commerce brand  revenues  million  x multiple
tech companies earn big multiples build asset deeply technical (eg cruise automation huge network effects (eg snapchat absent similar differentiator dnvbs e commerce companies garner non tech multiples  x sales range
as founders need build revenue order justify larger sale unfortunately founders raise capital finance growth turn increases size exit required make sale work
a founder said day vc years ask model early stage vcs think taboo ask model pervasive belief traditional metrics apply taken extreme dangerous
we make decisions solely models  help illuminate way founder thinks business math necessary ensure win way types dnvb businesses live die based models
founders ca rely viral coefficients strong network effects deep technology moats justify stratospheric valuations instead need gross margin ensure afford increasing acquisition costs create cashflow fund expansion
it varies business  dnvb startups generally need  x acquisition cost margin succeed ceos dnvbs obsess creating perfect facebook ad featuring photogenic models  really need spend time honing financial model excel
if you’ve built genuinely disruptive market leader bezos esqe ability leverage public markets ignore advice business likely  acquired ipo need start thinking carefully acquirers business track record acquisitions look like kinds prices tend pay
in traditional tech world paint picture uncapped future facebook ability monetize seemingly infinite content hand market goods finite bags shoes possibly  sold presents inherent market caps exit caps

nailing right product brand messaging easy  art science building model equally hard  reach  open spreadsheet time upfront right rush raise capital learn love laws retail you’ll learn hard lesson today hot seller tomorrow bargain bin special
