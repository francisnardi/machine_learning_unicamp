after recent article about empty states i lucky interview request from holly jade user experience (ux designer credentials including tedx apple google during interview i went terrified rambling mode
holly putting kind primer involved ux design called uxonomy idea project clearly define ux says young field wide open interpretation
i’m spot asked real time i think i’m writer i spend hours formulating points longer subconsciously developing idea  inevitably i asked what compelling ux compelling ux designed way does cause disconnect expectation reality i said
how pretentious i thought i’m thinking straight let try to clear writing
have come app ideal the copy landing page crystal clear promises fix problems exact way you’d like screenshots simple powerful ui intuitive navigation clear connection trigger action

 
a minute later signing free trial pro plan soon inside app

bloody hell i thought it’d  decent  terrible right competitors i’ve certainly i bet too
that environment landing page perfect sucking drawing page exciting hitting action the format good getting new users good honesty reality setting users stick long
this article disconnect expectation reality misalignment design writing development ruin hard work
expectations created by
the reality is
i’ll look ways  misleading users increasing likelihood will churn out before giving app chance
in article i’m going look reasons disconnect causes problems fix it
after i got phone holly i started looking real term i’d talking turns theory known as the principle astonishment (pola
much material i about pola years old  crazy think topic addressed open long especially applies today what means that design behave way the user expects behave example expect to use finger draw numbers calculator blue underlined piece text  hyperlink better  traditional to create friction
an interesting way reframing ux think journey starting user gets inside app makes marketing big puts the responsibility designers developers writers equal measure because designers developers writers aligned vision  astonishment line  good kind
once users app self contained environment controllable issue external expectations interactions as peter seebach wrote ibm back  navigating pages identifying objects functions figuring functions hitting button hard hope it’ll something
even  years later apps instead web pages statement makes sense does feel dated designers face challenges did variation astonish users  quickly communicate ui
since brain loves familiarity (until gets outright sick connecting ui elements universal actions solid way quickly onboard users unfortunately  control kind influences users bring them
may calculator that only accepts input drawing screen like great idea  madness common practice user expectations outset control
as scott berkun says  essay how avoid foolish consistency people like learn things time learn expect  able apply knowledge places follows good designers conserve number things users need learn stuff done
an example practice experience after buying smartphone recently time (do laugh i excited install inbox gmail mobile mail app i’d used needs activation mobile i switched gmail inbox desktop mobile
because i used swiping right left process emails inbox i decided try gmail ios ridiculous inbox swiping archives email group emails gmail brings up the option to archive

this might problem i not already used inbox  gmail feels clunky counterintuitive that consider ux perspective competing apps users  switching gestures apps smoother fewer steps friction job done
now we’ve worked nature problem let look ways fix it
there main factors marketing material surrounding software that will influence users interact app copywriting visuals
when copywriting paid proper attention products fall trap style substance says art at gathercontent
i’ve worked projects past i did care tasked like just easier oversell bother reality product convinced wo convince easily
while copywriting according wikipedia is used persuade person group ux perspective focus pure honesty after going pola copy landing page social proof astonishing app  disappointing means sign ups  drop  bigger
going hilarious idea landing page microsoft notepad thing unwitting future notepad user sees they’d  terrible shock
what common point contact users for companies it their landing page demystification place false representations places such social media honest landing page prove rumors untrue snap better worse
when user finds exist you’ve got consider impression giving modern flat website dated app make difference creating wrong expectations
another example experience i using markdown text editor ia writer phone quest to write efficiently i seeing i windows alternative saw this question on quora is good minimalistic markdown enabled writing application windows i use windows pc envy certain mac apps ia writer byword alternatives windows i especially like instant markdown support focus features apps
the answer suggested markdownpad i expected that look like ia writer  i saw looked like this

who fault developer  just (and partially microsoft
even developer prepared markdownpad look hiding landing page i’d foolishly expected things  different (after coming terms fact just windows apps look i went downloaded anyway
you ca control expectation user we’ve seen there ways stop expectations damaging reality said pola  dangerous progression
the idea design astonish controversial art form kind communication told marcel duchamp sign urinal astonish told fuck off

with said useful look scott berkun essay foolish consistency defends need change  i’d agree we’d  command line cutting magnetic tape edit videos
he says rare cases going pola is pointless conformity similar functionally different uis stretching feel sake consistency  ridiculous berkun gives example ui pac man driving game which are both games  need  operated different ways
even abandoned wordpress blog truly saddest things i think great thing researching fringe topics coming blogs knew existed
it abandoned blog i nugget quote from louis dietvorst
the fact humans open pain discomfort (if say using software we care that the secret happiness low expectations and determined  disappointed pretty anything
it strange say surprise users  design common communication facilitation signed urinal
