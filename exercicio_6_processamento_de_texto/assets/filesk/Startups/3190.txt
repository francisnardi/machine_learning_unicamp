from programs help visually impaired safety features cars detect large animals auto organizing untagged photo collections extracting business insights socially shared pictures benefits image recognition computer vision just beginning make way world   doing increasing frequency depth
it busy upcoming ldv vision summit annual conference dedicated things visual tech vr cameras medical imaging content analysis year advancements computer vision days creating tremendous new opportunities analyzing images exponentially impacting business vertical automotive advertising augmented reality says evan nisselson ldv capital organizes summit
as forms ai  natural language procession bioinformatics gaming  field computer vision benefited greatly expansion open source deep learning technology user friendly programming tools faster affordable computing
many headline references deep learning artificial intelligence big thing  exactly different tools work ways businesses using offer image tech world google tensorflow thing facebook deepface microsoft project oxford exactly help clarify things quick breakdown current image technology tools businesses using them
thanks deep learning techniques machine learning technique loosely modeled human brain computers  taught accurately identify pictures faster   need massive amounts data to it
enter imagenet pascal voc years making massive free  databases contain millions images tagged keywords inside pictures  cats mountains pizza sports activities open datasets basis machine learning images (the way computers accurately identify cats photos learned cats look like analyzing millions pictures tagged word cat
best known annual visual recognition challenge imagenet launched computer scientists stanford princeton   tagged images grown include  million tagged images grabs time machine training purposes
powered various universities uk pascal voc fewer pictures  richer annotations improves accuracy breadth machine learning applications speeds overall process because allows omission cumbersome computer subtasks

now google facebook startups universities use open source picture sets feed machine learning beasts  big technology companies advantage access millions user labeled images apps google photos facebook wondered google facebook let upload pictures free pictures used train deep learning networks  accurate
once data time build machine learn enter open source software libraries freely available frameworks serve starting points building machine learning systems service different kinds computer vision functions facial emotion recognition medical screening large obstacle (read deer detection cars machine learning systems fed pictures imagenet ilk proprietary images (aka google photos sources (like anonymized indexed clinical records
google tensorflow better known libraries covered widely selected parts open sourced late year tensorflow proprietary google used develop company ai initiatives autonomous cars translation google google photos
 tensorflow hardly   open source framework uc berkeley caffe  remains popular ease customizability large community innovators mention heavy use pinterest yahoo!/flickr google turns caffe certain projects deepdream
created  torch popular owing use facebook ai research (fair open sourced modules early  tools optimized run graphics processor computer amplify capacity speed deep learning process similarly nvidia cudnn open source software library optimizes computer graphics processing unit (gpu performance making machine learning faster
these tools flexible robust require teams computer vision engineers hardware companies want make computer vision major product strategy they’d want software need apply
not company resources wants invest resources build computer vision engineering te you’ve right te  lot work just right hosted api services come carried cloud solutions offer menus box image recognition services  easily integrated existing app used build specific feature entire business
say travel channel needs landmark detection relevant photos landing pages specific landmarks eharmony wants filter unsafe profile images uploaded users companies needs wants deep learning image recognition development business  benefit capabilities
google cloud vision example offers series image detection services facial optical character recognition (text landmark explicit content detection charges photo basis microsoft cognitive services (née project oxford offers collection visual image recognition apis including emotion celebrity face detection charges specific rate  transactions startups like clarifai offer computer vision apis help companies organize content filter unsafe user generated images videos make purchasing recommendations based viewed taken photos

of course does  apples oranges computer vision engineering teams need  google sized companies big small want build ai systems want robust custom image recognition solutions beauty cosmetics company wants say pictures people high volume hair serve ads body minimizing shampoo it’ll need create custom algorithm search high volume hair thing commoditized solutions offer box
same logos car make model niche commercial applications currently available open source arena closed dataset readily available matter good percentage images shared social media days public  making rich source images feed machine learning beast
some companies use combinations open data open source frameworks long te engineers just use hosted apis computer vision staking entire business
and companies wide range specific needs custom solutions matter approached clear image recognition rarely exists isolation stronger access more pictures real time big data unique applications speed businesses make connections ones  best poised success
