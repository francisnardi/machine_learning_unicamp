in edward snowden deems unprecedented hackers calling shadow brokers collected nsa created malware staging server run theequation group internal hacking te shadow brokers published chunks data open chunk encrypted file containing best files sell  million wikileaks said auction files publish course
they’ve released images file tree containing script kiddie like trove exploits ostensibly created used nsa well as page calling cyber warriors wealthy elites page contains links files encrypted cangrab using bittorrent here


the free file contains staging programs designed inject malware various servers cursory inspection files look  functional damaging nsa hackers quickly deploy tools close infiltrations trace unclear files  used damage networked computers  i’m sure value trove
