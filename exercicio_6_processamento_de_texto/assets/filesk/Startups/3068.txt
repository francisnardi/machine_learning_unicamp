for entrepreneurs artists people idea burning way souls crowdfunding way turning dreams reality backers campaigns way  tastemakers  cutting edge new cool newest gadgets available shops
there lot love crowdfunding  challenges campaigns raised money crowdfunding platforms step away refusing responsibility kickstarter puts particularly succinctly oversee projects performance mediate disputes users states terms use
fwdforce is a new crowdfunding platform examined crowdfunding works  and does work company came private beta week believes different model make raising money crowd safer transparent experience involved
 i doubts solution offer effective one
fwdforce wants involve users process earlier add layer accountability way lets anybody submit pitch product establishes checks balances for the prototyping production process it says model make things accountable backers
current crowdfunding platforms fail bring viable products market said moshe baum founder ceo fwdforce looking shake space new model dramatically increase products market
 
the platform turns crowdfunding model head introducing concept challenges challenge essentially idea product believes exist crowdfunding campaign based it
it valiant effort actually bad idea   opinion company failing accomplish goals platform bad  misunderstand people use crowdfunding
to participate challenge companies submit concepts project backers vote on a shortlist concepts winning concepts receive funding to prototype prototypes  submitted testing deadline prototypes tested party lab winner declared concept advances stage
projects platform moment include smarter bicycle locks portable d printers drones and wireless earbuds interesting selection projects tried crowdfunding platforms significant public failures past  fwdforce believes applying logic proceedings its campaigns fare better
we consider crowdfunding platform baum emphasizes instead refers doing crowd powered innovation platform
a successful project series steps order bring product fruition following process different current crowdfunding sites
of course things wrong steps fwdforce plans deal eventualities
for example prototypes pass muster remaining money refunded later process product fails pass qa criteria delivery second te line gets shot
 
we remaining funds provide refund allow second line challenger try production says baum we want to provide user best resources guidance make sure successful final production baum said confirming guarantee delivery
if plan fails point way remainder money  refunded user two caveats company planning to refund  percent fees charges run campaign offer refunds  percent processing fee

crucially campaigns missing is heart
take campaign like road legal electric motorbike fits shippable case extremely interesting idea  immediately raises barrage questions that the campaign unable relatively sparse information page
in opinion it unlikely  build functional prototype risks project point  certain of delivery especially failing consider that requirements bike road legal specifying jurisdictions
or project i  writing money pledged one is trying create non lethal self defense weapon  legal  states  prototyping budget design development unlikely happen  weapons  non lethal ones  complicated require extensive testing let talk legal costs challenges bring a product like market
the fatal problem i believe that fwdforce ideas misses the point people care crowdfunding backers invest money crowdfunding campaigns buy dre people campaign together
at stage development fwdforce crowdfunding campaigns happening expect find the level passion projects like coolest cooler exploding kittens or pono music
these projects  funded projects kickstarter did succeed great ideas fact i suggest ideas profoundly daft point these ideas have raised much money at the ideas stage

the corollary i believe platform ever see multi million dollar fundraiser simply wo experience levels success kickstarter elite have seen
fwdforce raises fantastic questions around ought run crowdfunding campaigns they work crowdfunding community  grateful discussion ought continue here
nonetheless company presented answers required order solve challenges hand i’m convinced crowdfunding landscape noticeably better now platform live
