there huge disconnect private public company valuations years
this time i’ve said it it probably wo  last
during period froth companies able raise capital increasingly ludicrous valuations entrepreneurs turned fundraising sport  with associated bragging rights deals closed peaked   time funding hit highest point year meaning  saw largest funding rounds date
the net result exuberance pissing match valuations capital raised so recruiters famously used attributes key selling points trying hire
most recognized bubble (yes bubble currently undergoing fledged correction pendulum power control swinging investor community proverbial pendulum problem lies
i’ve involved tech community operator investor  years i’ve row seat course numerous cycles change ball control i believe gets lost hubris egomania fact entrepreneurs vcs need  successful  round keenly pointed recent letter limited partners

said way low prices unmotivated teams good vcs similarly high prices crappy vc returns good entrepreneurs  implicit bad returns fact vcs wo  able raise funds subsequently invest new companies
and numbers lie average size m&a deals remained relatively flat past seven years (whatsapp cause  spike
over months i’ve seen vc peers salivating dramatic change pricing increased leverage deals openview certainly experienced change hand longer companies coming multiple term sheets valuation expectations  x arr range timelines measured days weeks
instead seeing folks coming term sheets suggesting market dictate valuation immediate timeline
frankly i think good thing everybody
when reflect   timeframe i think  view healthy period ecosystem funds raised deployed time yield crappy results deployed formula speed   months versus   years  sky high valuations

the unfortunate byproduct latest boom cycle left vcs bad taste mouths looking extract leverage i concerned hearing more vcs talking issuing term sheets option deal assumption trade deal just walk away brad feld wrote great post this
clearly fomo left building
so i’m requesting fellow vcs i think admit prices whack needed come come probably continue slide quarters entrepreneurs recognize bods recognize need focus quashing bad juju created misbehaving deal process
this behavior simply does help anyone
if excited company work issuing term sheet time ticking game clock openview business diligence issuing term sheet  post term sheet confirmatory ironically process price discipline precisely did deals year
issuing term sheet figure like deal destructive entrepreneurs previous cycles developed natural distrust vcs given bad behavior entrepreneurs looked extract leverage pendulum swung favor  
now chance stop perpetuating cycle work offer price works firm remember playing upside managing downside let draw blood stone time wo  companies priority price capital instead symbiotic equilibrium
vcs entrepreneurs need  successful forget that
