as founder  proof software development agency silicon valley catering pre  post money companies i’ve observed quite bit variance comes development process
the capabilities range wildly hack slash oh shit commits way buttoned tests infrastructure makes giddy it pretty good bad fugly
it boils core competencies te experience technical leadership amazes companies start doing wrong granted startup companies gun hurry build great product and find relevance market mind shiny bells whistles involved got produced
in chapters lean startup eric ries explains honed process developer commit code production day work does mean gave new geek keys kingdom power destroy service means tech te process place checks balances break things  newbie
the challenge enterprises face lack innovation slow response change large companies trying adopt agility scale enterprise set intrapreneuer programs innovate enterprises tend  exception
the upper hand startup companies chance right time…  reality economics time/talent/capital startups means running  mph goal  leaving wake technical debt them
 ‘doing right’ ask simply means code continuously tested integrated engineer commits code source repository popular alternative mix of
the adopted solution house parties automated user interface testing aka end end functional testing best achieved building tests day  project instead waiting filling later point time requirements user stories translated tests exercise feature possible user persona needless say i’m bullishly anti house party comes testing quality
you awesome tests developers certainly run working environment  key continuously run test server environment continuous integration (ci server time engineer checks code repository ci server wakes gets work
ideally unit tests run run faster functional tests run large applications ci server break ideally parallelize functional tests save time automated test cycle takes long use i’ve upper bound   minutes max test cycle obviously shorter  productive team
by building tests automated web browser drive user interface make sure it still works intended keeps codebase moving backwards production stops presses resolved fix build
many dev shops i’ve visited special monitor room turns red i’ve seen usb traffic light evidence build health
besides environmental indicators build i’ve seen variations maintaining quality  passing little pony placing shamefully desk engineer broke build geeks say media
i prefer positive reinforcement  sprint demo medium sized trophy adorned mardi gras beads awarded geek best feature week geeks lyft
the benefit emphatic testing user interface level increase product quality this ui test akin to a contract  broken tests evolving requirements serve watchdog make sure rolling backwards
in chatting geeks spend time testing early company project i  tilt user interface inevitably exercises layers ui works underlying layers probably doing right
the exception product api unit tests going  way really perfect world functional unit tests  place go
a challenge startups product continually changes byproduct build/measure/learn cycle stage right overlay end end tests
this open ended question i ponder company really has idea build limiting value probably users quality concern
when company knows needs build  roadmap daunting talent limited natural skip functional tests now
 quality   concern right end trade going  longer build cycle  x i’d guesstimate adds  percent project good functional unit tests week sprint days weeks
so hurry product i favor slow right probably living new features release long time
the payout clearly road efforts good testing creates codebase delightful work future engineers creates codebase lives longer easier refactor stand test time
the idea i’d like leave startup founders lead techies please! please! test user interface do early progression payouts  plentiful road
