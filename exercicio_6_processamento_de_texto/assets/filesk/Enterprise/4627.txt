nothing critical software service (saas business pricing strategy pricing moment truth new product … doubly company product  far i’ve observed new startups leaving money table comes pricing enterprise products i’ve seen founders say product saves hundreds thousands dollars  product priced saving thousands dollars
one reason assuming need price progr similarly competitive products potentially disruptive product falling trap pricing like legacy competitor leaves money table   fail surface differentiation said way product is your price price product reflects value buyer perspective company believes valuable saas products advantage priced just service offer  potential saving massive capex/opex spent directly customer
from business perspective saas products level stickiness  envy packaged premise software generation
since uncertainty social science aspects pricing  uncomfortable especially technical founders framework  perspective product manager  consider pricing new saas products product manager role critical saas ability fine tune monetization product closely tied features implementation product needs  designed flexibility mind comes making features available prioritizing features just choosing spend engineering time
just remember business physics gurley notes excellent post on metrics andreessen horowitz a detailed primer on understanding saas valuations great background pricing discussions pricing math tendency create spreadsheet model assume work  ton psychology comes play math pricing involves judgment vision flexibility
how solve unsolvable problem bound it
in new business easy spend money  combination new product and the unknown cost acquiring customers leads unsolvable problem approach lean/iterative methods apply finding right pricing fit post framework arrive early prices change (this different happens existing company existing customers really shot pricing right
the business saas involves complex array of variables such customer lifetime value (ltv customer/subscriber acquisition cost (cac average revenue user (arpu cost goods sold (cogs churn pricing models freemium tiered time based depending targeting consumers enterprises different sales models influence pricing approach (for example business products invite complexity especially dealing purchasing managers similarly product saas complex set equations related usage patterns scenarios variable costs large number resources
the critical costs related customer acquisition sales/marketing expense  appear erase potential profit traditional accounting measures  key early stage saas businesses focus understanding customer acquisition costs relative estimated long term value customer know cost acquire customer just forward assuming budget (along allocation margin ultimate price relative long term value post focuses pricing models relative product features assumes higher level view customer acquisition costs long term value
one way approach establish upper lower bounds pricing
a lower bound pricing
the lower bound represents costs serve customer product common example basic costs spinning iaas/paas elements  creating accounts allocating minimal resources infrastructure subsequent usage
it  convenient think lower bound offer free customers make assumptions use variable resources compute egress storage order arrive lower bound (note product centric view bounds absent allocation fixed variable costs outside product/technology not include opex s&m etc
it important understand bound breadth product initially view features premium want assume time capabilities migrate advanced essential new features i think good exercise consider product base case initially
an upper bound pricing
the upper bound represents costs serve depth user case customer using parts product drive ongoing costs scale (for example customer using increasingly bandwidth storage compute now this is look offer relative competition want understand scale attributes better/worse/same knowing begin separate variables model
presumably developing product created unique architectural approach relative existing competitors scale better tenants use storage effectively mobile app efficient bandwidth importance knowing strengths weaknesses inform variables use pricing
you think upper bound competitive foil  stronger attribute use attribute differentiate offering allow charge capabilities just expensive competition
these core attributes pricing
when pricing new offering worth understanding product today relative core set potential pricing attributes
whether bronze/silver/gold free/select/premium trial/select/premium individual/business/enterprise norm saas offer xn matrix  pricing plans n attributes  inthese examples mature saas product rows columns matrix (one saas product i researched level features organized array  price points based combinations features number users
a broad range saas products  considered following core service attributes
features
if product lends dividing features  import/export visualization view/edit connectivity products  good better best differentiating price points work freemium model dividing features  free v paid users  customer hostile way differentiate optimize pricing beware
the reason hesitate dimension customers understand basically just inhibiting access code draconian reason  cautious model usage product deepens time paid features tend pulled lower priced tiers  means need new features/prices release update easy communicate general use features pricing tiers level distaste approach customers
administration/it
one common approaches differentiating saas product designed business separate focused features pricing attribute  features security audit identity integration domain names sharing control management businesses understand like value pay features
commonly approach used to rectify a product  viral enterprise  careful approach enterprise pricing come arsonist firefighter offering contain situation knowingly created
scale consumption
another broadly used saas pricing attribute storage consumption (even products storage primary attribute easy measure easy articulate relatively expensive benefit using storage people degree gets cheaper faster people consume (and scenarios customers need  doing fairly extreme consume vast amounts storage time platform companies steadily increasing free storage ultra low priced storage base frills service simply using storage dimensional offering work new saas product  sure consider ways avoid basing costs storage given challenges
one novel approach seen recently using party storage letting customer establish paying relationship storage pricing product way serve pure pass visibly priced party element product novel attributes modern software  used consumption variables relatively new use depth consumption apis/calls price tiering structure (box i’m advisor recently announced pricing for box apis as example developer oriented products work especially consumption pricing developers understand product architecture drive costs costs variable usage
scale consumers
saas products used small teams cross organizations just scale members collaborating/sharing/using  priced number unique users (and subsequent integration organization based directories pricing variable straightforward time distribution engagement resource usage let refine discrete price points
because products priced way want encourage users/usage carefully consider step  large scale customers like approach allows predictable pricing metric understand number employees/users general think seat pricing  apply device end points servers/cpus vms etc
 
segmenting customers
every product used different customer segments  measured size organization industry segment geography type individual organization common pricing tier labels include government non profit academic healthcare small business on
as product matures certainly label expand pricing tiers account jump level differentiation want gain data usage  seeing customers set segments using product differently importantly path develop differentiation allows target sustain segments (or just optimizing revenue lines products designed specific segments like education allows refine public private post secondary etc
 customer segment  special the engaged technical user these folks push product organization required develop custom solutions platform deliver enhance value work
developers key regard platform oriented product worth considering offer developers ability experiment use product development environment low price way accomplish separate usage development versus usage production price accordingly
* * *
as new offering established competitors pricing  easiest point attack disruptive product want deepest possible understanding value bringing table maximize initial pricing model important suggestion pricing i to wait possible moment to price announce
even enterprise products things like round numbers ′s discounts matter mind discounting  substantial enterprise products direct sales  list price uncommon (and required excuse bloat price  important purchasing managers empowering salesforce enable level customization  know variables using so
some say change raise prices gate  mind customers price changes product composition relative price viewed positive changes think customers lowering price change prices  offer existing customers time adapt grandfather (at finally remember engineer product framework support pricing flexibility
create model use model  let model thinking price carefully!
