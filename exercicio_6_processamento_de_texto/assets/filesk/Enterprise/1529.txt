long restricted academic domain li fi light based data delivery method suddenly getting sorts attention estonian startup velmenni recently tested commercial implementation  superior wi fi way  i probably use
velmenni technology called jungru uses led bulb transmits data gigabit speed theoretical speed  gigabytes second bbc reported jungru product commercially viable based  laboratory grade matlab simulink setup paired photodiodes opposed final product transmit data real world environments light pollution variables
university edinburgh professor harald hass demonstrated li fi d light project school institute digital communications Â he gave  ted global talk   despite companies interested start li fi consortium technology commercial contender

the technology uses protocols similar rf band  protocols additional standards eliminate impacts interference impacts ambient lighting despite technology  deployed outdoors sunlight odd conditions
while li fi does come advantage interfering radio signals lot benefits overpowered simple fact visible light travel walls essential factor gives old school wi fi huge advantage line sight limitation does make secure gives better control emissions  unclear minimum distance signal reception  clear line sight achieved mind easy imagine signal intercepted telephoto lens optical sensor tuned appropriately li fi touted possible channel wireless communications airplanes widespread adoption onboard wi fi airlines makes use case less pertinent

led lightbulbs use technology appear visually different  information encoded pulses light small rapid perturbations  undetectable naked eye attractive envision network connected lightbulbs used transmit data nodes clear benefits faster wireless communication outweigh costs constantly led lights cost optical detectors requiring clear line sight
there certainly room li fi visible light based communication systems grow niche areas  router manufacturers rest easy wi fi going soon router bought black friday offers piddly  mbps speeds benefits rf
