once time when wanted secure value vault distributed keys today want secure software credentials especially services use digital secrets manager distribute virtual keys
hashicorp announced early release open source secrets manager today appropriately called vault tool provides range services including secure key secret management transit encryption automated key creation key revocation detailed audit logs
the problem solving core storing secrets  passwords credentials certificates forth mitchell hashimoto founder hashicorp explained
that increasingly important as world moves micro services containerization  think docker  requires passing credentials myriad services keeping containers secure challenge
the need service oriented identity communication container security container identity really higher said software service talk (or service requires api key credentials so

the problem managing multiple credentials communicate different pieces infrastructure real challenge perspective timing product  better  hashimoto says nice benefit really company developed it
like products vault emerged internal need driven customers hashicorp (now open source products sells commercial end open source tools called atlas requires credentials to services connects pros reluctant simply enter company credentials party tool like atlas security

hashimoto admits terribly exciting  solves problem provides open source mechanism dealing gets interesting system can create new credentials automatically every time need credentials limited shelf life making harder steal hacker obtained credentials longer work might only work limited time
that means secrets disk anymore hashimoto said  persistent application request new credentials store memory hit physical storage explained
and solves huge problem hackers breaking password databases password database treasure steal (at password cache
to protect requires multiple keys make changes setting decide keys want need perform operation typically customers generate keys requires perform operation akin a vault required keys  turned certain time open
while says knows completely fool proof ability audit revoke does deal administrators stronger security hand   chances rogue administrators operating tandem pretty remote
hashicorp come idea commercial offerings amazonhsm this offers dedicated hardware security module (hsm appliance lets customers control encryption keys cryptographic operations cloud
this early release hashimoto calls version  company working financial services clients product paces believes it can pass muster banks financial services securing environments prove easier
