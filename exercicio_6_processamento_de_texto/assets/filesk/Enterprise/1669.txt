a princeton new jersey startup called arable labs recently unveiled professional grade crop weather sensor solar powered rugged designed fred bould creative talent nest thermostat smoke carbon monoxide detector fitbit gopro roku products
the pulsepod looks like head small drum translucent small frisbee contains sensing technology including band spectrometer  way net radiometer acoustic rain gauge solar powered does need  plugged require frequent battery replacement
its sensors enable pulsepod constantly monitor crop growth regrowth grass pasture rainfall crop water demand light heat levels color berries bush kale leaves grapes vine important determining harvest readiness crops
arable ceo founder ad wolf said data quality profound measures observation streams embedded device world outside medicine sending data cloud  accessed analyzed real time
the idea arable sprang founder academic research work forecasting maize growth kenya zambia african markets facing severe drought economic impacts food scarcity resulting said
growers using arable hardware cloud based software figure harvest timing potential yield growing
early adopters company software sensors include valley irrigation makers center pivot sprinklers equipment for commercial farms yara international global fertilizer manufacturer based norway francis ford coppola winery treasury wine estates berry growers driscoll blue marble microinsurance

designer fred bould equity investor arable said and a design te eponymous design services firm spent long hours field observing farmers forecasters agronomists understand exactly handle arable technology everyday work flow  vineyard arbors field of lettuce
designing like nest worry people throwing truck dropping post feet almond tree packed gravel bould said
bould design arable engineers had consider pulsepod would work machinery use farms too
bould recalled watched people harvesting strawberries saw equipment passes rows plants saw picking wagons people walk strawberries containers saw mad max like machines chop things sticking feet vine asked position wo disintegrated  parts
the arable  easy set durable  working  years position field bould said
the final device includes port allows users connect hardware example cameras or auxiliary sensors
wolf said longer term arable  utilized agriculture example help cities manage urban flooding water quality fires  company remains focused needs food farmers
in addition hardware arable offers cloud based app developer tools including api help farmers business work custom forecasting modeling analysis data gather ground
the company aims reduce food waste volatile perishable commodities ultimately make farming predictable wolf said
