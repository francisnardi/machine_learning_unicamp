dronedeploy is mission make drones accessible industrial users a business need conducting outdoor landscape mapping monitoring words wants drones  work by people than enthusiastic dorks gadget habit  doing tasks like helping farmers spot crop damage and disease
it doing making a software service platform makes controlling managing uavs easier is  simplified web app interface ios android mobile apps dronedeploy platform autonomously pilots drone user learn themselves
as doing mapping dronedeploy cloud platform takes care data processing speed entire operation  delivering processed data user real time easily shareable format act drone delivered intel having wrangle tech itself
that kind dirty secret drones says founder ceo mike winn people say i’ve got amazing flying machine got rotors flies cool look product d model produce growth map fields   talks space drone actually make growth map fields takes   clicks time windows laptop need buy  pieces software going  hours processing time actually make images map looking for
we hide complexity just mobile phone turn drone press buttons phone drone launch it’ll capture imagery it’ll process imagery it’ll deliver imagery map d model matter minutes
the core feature offered dronedeploy point tailored current customer focus farmers construction companies mining companies namely aerial imagery used for photogrammetry offer mapping d modeling large areas (of hundreds acres and provide volumetric estimates
more features come line just beginning says winn drone fly create data autonomously way  step start processing data going level deeper where we automatically detect change
in future tell construction sites happened day start things like automatically tell rail companies obstruction path railway line right we’ve started thing giving data  software we’ve created cloud gives infinite resources  able process really exciting computer science figure happening changing world help businesses data

drones  used judge crop health monitoring fast plants growing  using infrared cameras
what startup  using new funding scaling meet hopes  strong demand range industries says winn starting build additional powerful features atop data it collecting saas platform level (as were
