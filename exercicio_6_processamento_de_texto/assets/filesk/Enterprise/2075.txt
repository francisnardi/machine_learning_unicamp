the dockercon user conference recently concluded san francisco evidence container movement gaining momentum clear  + attendees  sponsors  exhibitors
add approximately  million vc investment container related companies date lists hot startups beginning appear anointing new paradigms respected investors user surveys record breaking buying intention scores doubt container wave propelled devops engineer new power buyer enterprise
i expect impact containers  similar virtualization impact data center
the key difference virtualization containers described mitchell hashimoto devops guru founder data center automation management company hashicorp virtualization like sci fi concept terraforming planet embracing containers akin building isolated biodomes single planet
virtualization created platform company vmware looks like docker visionary approach rewarded mover advantage just host independent players provided adjacent services created virtualization era i greenfield potential entrepreneurs founding container related companies today
here opportunities container ecosystem
operating systems container world need heavy operating systems like traditional redhat linux windows server
several lightweight operating systems adapted designed containers including redhat atom coreos microsoft nano vmware project photon rancher labs rancheros addition rancher labs provides complete infrastructure platform running docker production
orchestration google kubernetes provides orchestration management solution docker containers clustered environment accelerate dev simplify ops supported coreos others
mesosphere provides data center operating support containers example multiple machines make look like single computer mesosphere optimizes orchestration docker containers scale
storage expand use containers stateful enterprise applications you’ll need storage layer enterprise features data persistence nodes container level snapshots clones etc
portworx provides elastic scale block storage natively docker containers enables rapid deployment scaling stateless stateful enterprise applications
just like host storage providers carved valuable areas virtualization era including par nutanix pure storage vee software i think containers create a new breed independent storage companies
networking similarly need container aware networking services weave creates virtual network connects docker containers deployed multiple hosts enables automatic discovery
in buy versus build decision docker acquired socketplaneio provide offerings space similar services provided f nicira software defined infrastructure world i believe  independent providers similar services container world
security security problem  solved containers docker host startups including twistlock providing offerings area
management containerized applications deployed production environments  increasing need management solutions like ibm tivoli hp openview previous eras
examples container specific products companies category include the monitoring service sysdig hashicorp atlas application infrastructure management configuration management companies like chef puppet container specific offerings now
these primary areas ripe innovation  break large independent category business models flux monetization lagging typically does time new technology gets developed
throughout career i’ve seen painkillers sell better vitamins companies solve pain points make money companies provide vitamins harder time
a good example container space docker founded paas pivot  container company documented  early times examples solutions tuck ins versus stand candidates begun emerge docker acquiring kitematic koality orchard socketplane
a couple examples features include companies providing paas containers development environments ui interfaces conversion tools end platform companies
the field nascent recent open container news illustrated coalitions just formed wildcard container space vmware understands necessity containers  wants run virtual world
however fair say vmware disrupted containers today way disrupted server hardware market past  years
all developments make exciting phase bold entrepreneurs want build giants containerized era fruitful times investors looking partner them
