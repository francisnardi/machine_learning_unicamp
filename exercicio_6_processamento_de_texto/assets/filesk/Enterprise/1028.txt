mathias biilmann  cto firm built websites small businesses  says developers gotten used using github central workflow expect entire rest developer experience work way
the way end developer work  server change things structured  git came  basic way operating biilmann founder netlify said more expectation pushing git something happens
that goal for his founder chris bach new company netlify basically initiates kind repository pushes github repository services updates execute distributed wide network content delivery networks to deliver pre built static pages visitors  netlify picking best cloud services available netlify distributes static sites content delivery network meaning visitors access pages pre built
the idea instead of a progr running time visitor goes page pre loading user immediately served page directed closest geographic server order reduce load times more dynamically built pages  vulnerable slowdowns suddenly spike traffic biilmann said
the hope simplifying deployment process convince developers looking lightweight page experience use like netlify instead simply deploying directly amazon web services providers company raised  million bloomberg beta tank hill ventures
part process developed time simply pushing git updates directly server like aws expectation time  simply run push update command line expect work end  increasing expectation time especially end developers biilmann and te decided build set tools bundled necessary components building pages deploying them
so netlify enables developers roll changes larger network servers easily  rolled kinds simple updates and  directly command line interface

so pre built reasons visiting site page build dynamically based applications running like amazon web services requires page build  leaves open opportunity malicious attacks (like finding vulnerability flask server example essentially pushing site isolation cdn tapping dynamic setup  open attack

if developer ends breaking line code quickly roll previous instance site operations  command line interface netlify users view snapshot running pages web based interface monitor health
at moment netlify does serve tools interact database layer biilmann says primarily modern pages implement experience hooked set apis services example gave  running comments api like disqus running search functions api
investors netlify include heroku founder ad wiggins github founder tom preston werner clearly helping individuals deploy fuller  faster  website experiences simpler developer experience
the challenge netlify experiences simple quickly adjust developer demands kinds tools stretch imagine like aws implementing similar tool developers running aws  hard peel away  biilmann says larger companies enjoyed capability deploy kinds experiences tools like help attract wider long tail developer activity
