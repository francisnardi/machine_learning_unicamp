ibm introduced new open source development tool today called quarks supposed help manufacturers programmers develop efficient applications based internet things (iot sensor data
quarks is actually based ibm streams product proprietary enterprise tool processing large amounts live data  it been designed ground offer programmers manufacturers open source tool for building applications connected devices idea to provide way for them advantage live data coming devices simple efficient way
for example you could track health diabetic using a wearable device employee working oil rig wearing a helmet fitted sensors
each scenarios like involve monitoring data sensor level accessing communicating data real time people (or devices need information immediately instance a sensor a miner safety helmet signals unsafe condition need know about it instantly ca  lag device communicates larger enterprise database and compares data
while these programs facilitate rapid device device device human communication does end there they potentially communicate this information enterprise broader comparison information similar devices time
in medical device scenario researchers group people react treatment regimen time patient doctor receive data regular basis track a patient overall health
this could potentially link watson health review corpus data medical condition measured offer feedback patient doctor appropriate proper course treatment
for quarks just getting started  ibm hopes to build community involved companies programmers the company goal time open source community catch development tool  a standard way building application type iot scenario
it worth noting earlier month cisco bought jasper technologies  billion specifically looking enterprise level internet things solution cloud shows ibm clearly  large technology companies recognizing finding ways capture store process iot data going  big business moving forward
ibm releasing quarks broader strategy grab a piece business time tell particular open source tool will catch  worth noting ibm submitted proposal apache foundation for quarks  incubation project way pushing along
