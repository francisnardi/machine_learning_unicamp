the paths approach
mary mesaglio research vp gartner says recognizes companies struggle deal types fundamental changes recommends similar strategy pivotal calls bimodal approach means remains unchanged continues deal systems record working deliberately install enterprise grade solutions long purchase implementation cycles just traditionally addition recommends creating second separate unit thinks fast acts quickly reacts changing market conditions constraints traditional it
as mesaglio puts mode  effective plan mode  effective plan create quickly seat pants explained mode  operates calls enlightened trial error experiment  purpose just random shots dark
much like pivotal mesaglio recommends creating separate place mode  te operate side mode  recipe culture war worse risk producing mode  warns muddled middle dangerous doing nothing
all said mesaglio told approaches ca stay diverged paths forever point mode   incorporated mainstre company  takes measured approach recommends starting slowly island project completely separate likely completely different company humana healthcare management app  example approach
over time need begin look integrated projects ones company kind competitive advantage suggests looking existing providing mode  solution example credit card comes renewal new solution offers modern context advantage data collecting credit card transactions understand loyal customers target special offers moves credit card purely operational provide a competitive advantage
the stage says cios want start sort existing end extend new channel usually mobile reason councils waiting mode  footing step stage requires mode   work side integrate existing end tools new tool proof points mode  deserves  taken seriously result bad cultural mix mode  te unnecessary risk
the final stage mode  reaches maturity creates new services integrate with backend systems difference previous level creating new opposed mobilizing existing tool cases integrate backend systems  stage service developing existed before
