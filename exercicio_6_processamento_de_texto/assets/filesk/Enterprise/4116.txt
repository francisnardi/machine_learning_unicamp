we’ve hearing great deal power big data couple years hype says that as gather data  able better answers business problems  data levels seen far could pale comparison happens start adding sensors world jet engines to soft drink vending machines car seats sensors explosion data likes we’ve seen  came small
and implications world device sending in data waiting database difficult imagine point
as natasha lomas pointed recent techcrunch article sensors sensitivity outcome  instead using devices deliberately measure activity world sensors pick activity measure world interact various sensors  having a specific device devoted it
the world gains ability perceive wearable sensors trying figure going environment taking a continuous measure lomas wrote
and extent early stages seeing this happen actually begins though peter levine partner venture capital firm andreessen horowitz sees addition pervasive sensor data industry altering event think happens internet things  pervasive endpoint devices trillions  sending information compute engine…we businesses humans want real time
and precisely real time element today relational databases struggle  as levine pointed talking jet engine security monitoring ca afford wait   hours process data need  able answers near real time
i wrote company trying process huge tracts data called adatao received m funding week led levine company  in fact writing company blog adatao funding levine say growing data
the promise big data ushered era data intelligence machine data human thought streams collecting data day  data world today created years alone in fact day create  quintillion bytes data  estimates new google days rate increasing… levine wrote
with kind numbers need better tools process data company recognizes problem ge builds huge industrial grade equipment like jet engines railroad locomotives pipelines electric grids wants instrument huge industrial devices better advantage data generate make operations run efficiently
to sense early process ruh vp of global software center ge says industry estimates suggest be b connected industrial assets place  estimates today just  percent devices equipped sensors lack intelligence hope future simply telling gone wrong
ge working pivotal to better understand problem (it worth noting ge owns  percent stake emc/vmware spinoff companies working build calling data lake flexible approach large data sets data warehouse point designed decade ago erp crm data mind quantity data today greater requires flexible architecture accommodate it
one areas ge testing this technology jet engine division estimates engine generate tb data data single flight multiply by many flights per day facing monumental amounts data just industrial device
ruh claims using data lake software cuts time begin working data days minutes did improve process according ge whittled down a data warehousing approach took  days ingest structure integrate and process brought  minutes data lake approach yes read correctly  minutes
if true claim that remarkable level efficiency gain takes account massive data deal just jet engine business
 ruh says did stop did want just data available fast sake proving  wanted data use better understand engine working possibly predict failures happened
to end combined technology developed consulting firm accenture build tool called taleris claim actually accurately predict failure the trouble needed data prediction platform job the data lake developed with pivotal gives that
zebra technologies company thinking lot folks bought motorola handheld solutions april b see a big connection zebra does barcode receipt kiosk rfid printer business handheld scanning business bought motorola future sensors warehouse
phil gerskovich svp new growth platforms zebra technologies says company thinking sensors play warehouse sees involving things
and says questions can apply talking employees fruit blue jeans technology today says hard large warehouse operations answer questions believes sensors change end company developed cloud based software framework called zatar describes platform connecting managing millions devices connecting enterprise applications make use stre information coming sensors whichever way makes sense context that particular piece software

companies like adatao projects like these going inside large companies like ge zebra sap proofs concept right  time types companies projects profound impact process deal big data paradox big data data overwhelming   takes large data best outcomes
the good news companies trying solve problems today majority sensors place inevitable big data onslaught comes time figure today transmitting data
