this morning intel confirmed bought altera maker programmable chips  billion like big number consider that avago technologies bought wireless chip maker broadcom week  billion
it good week  chip business
according published reports deal works months  avago broadcom sale pushed bit reason altera stock holders walked away happy bunch
every public purchase comes premium attached cases exception to that rule altera strong  percent regular trading today pushing valuation just  billion broadcom credit saw shares spike just  share comfortably  delta works  percent

the rise cloud computing let mobile explosion brought arm based systems greater prominence shifted chip market and akin facebook staring barrel whatsapp monied incumbents pull trigger large deals ensure remain monied incumbents
a parlor game ask chip company direct competition altera broadcom remains unpurchased decide firm space afford sticker price consolidation like sneeze me
when begin dig deal couple core reasons for intel going altera mark hung gartner analyst covers chip industry characterizes offensive defensive
