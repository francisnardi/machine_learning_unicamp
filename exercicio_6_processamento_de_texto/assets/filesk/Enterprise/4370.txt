companies face inherent tension open proprietary  we’ve seen open systems act catalysts entirely new businesses built popular platform
earlier month encountered examples approach tesla motors opened patents netflix decided shut severely limit access api (to  fair netflix makes lot valuable contributions open source
companies reasons isolating opening  open platform innovation tends happen
whether talking linux s hadoop openstack today we’ve seen broad agreement standard open way doing wide adoption standard companies develop build solutions standard platform meet variety needs
some high level applications management tools  time open systems acted launching pads new businesses creating essentially startup ecosystems
and works little bit openness like opening apis encouraging party developers build system
first numbers
to sense power open source platforms dozens companies listed crunchbase identify based open source just few examples cloudera company built open source apache hadoop platform raised whopping b date competitor hortonworks company built hadoop announced m new funding march total m date mesosphere company built open source mesos product raised m earlier month docker linux container company built open source docker project scored m earlier year
there countless examples companies building businesses open source projects landing big chunks venture capital  vcs handing millions millions dollars companies driving huge open source startup feeder system
and reason open platforms (even open source se act catalysts drive new companies companies head start terms access standard tool set community programming resources provide ready market needs solutions work platforms
opening operating systems
sean sucher cofounder ceo haddoop startup pepperdata argues microsoft windows examples widely adopted platform spawned thousands new companies noted operating systems options available late s early s  windows stuck (partly questionable market control tactics got trouble department justice regardless reason denying windows acted impetus launch new companies
in retrospect clearly know ubiquity microsoft windows enabled creation thousands companies personal computer operating systems  did adoption spawn industry sucher explained
while windows prime example wide adoption fuel kind ecosystem holes missing core product (and seen microsoft sharepoint kind ecosystem tends happen organically comes open source platforms
linux took step just allowing people build applications operating  open sourcing operating create entirely new versions donald fischer venture partner general catalyst partners venture capital firm boston palo alto original product manager red hat enterprise linux product created openness linux
that turn drove similar kind development platform saw windows creating companies driving red hat success entire thesis engine continues drive company ecosystem applications sits explained companies built applications produced flywheel effect continues day fed success company enterprise customers bought red hat enterprise linux companies building enterprise applications companies continued build applications popularity rhel fact earlier month red hat released version  rhel
the community impact
steve herrod cto cofounder vmware currently managing partner general catalyst says accessing community developers help fuel project  just recently saw docker  person company able launch version  product just  months partly relied community  developer partners help make happen clearly small company resources taken longer  making docker open source helped speed delivery product market
michael bushong vice president marketing plexxi says community aspect particularly important drives people contribute  bigger
another major shift going business world generally (and technology world specifically movement community particularly strong parts development community giving source pride people said
he believes driven social media desire build personal brand open source increases profile leads community recognition tech community tends laud open source contributors personal drivers open source participation branding extends companies employ people makes corporations likely support  actively staff open source initiatives bushong said
ready launch pad startups
the line using open source platforms simplifies development new companies gives common set functionality ready use saving tons valuable startup energy spent reinventing wheel time arje cahn cto open source content management vendor hippo says started company used open source platforms saved ton development time
hippo formed business apache cocoon apache jackrabbit early days realized large wanted build existed open platform cahn explained
he says means new companies save time money open source community wins
when business (like builds open platform agreed base set services plenty space pure innovation standards versioning cms space example versioning innovative commodity vendors agree stick jcr standard accept versioning feature space raise bar terms features developing time sharing collectively pushing innovate apache told me
and just hadoop open produce impact
ctera ceo liran eshel says cloud storage company benefited open source community particularly openstack
fundamentally open vibrant community cloud engineers enables ctera leverage investments innovators object storage compute frameworks scale systems management optimize focus investment true core competence cloud storage service platform  we product market faster enabling broader collection companies benefit cloud storage service delivery tools openstack said
open platforms provide established markets
chad carson founder vp product startup pepperdata says building broadly used platform like hadoop means new companies immediately access larger market past
today thousands companies using hadoop course doing thing  common set needs pain points business opportunities share company develops new product runs hadoop hundreds potential customers benefit  customers need evaluate specific product decide gamble new architecture unknown set problems order use new product told me
jerry chen partner greylock partners says open source builds markets makes easy try companies use products bigger market becomes
because open source reduces friction try platform like hadoop gets widely distributed open source great way distribution build customer base customers sell said explained open source companies open source users build open source platform happens project  stimulus new business creation
and carson says includes party integrators business benefit commonly used open platforms parties ready help companies evaluate apply new technologies basically ecosystem ecosystem example hadoop space company creates great new application distribution vendors ready incorporate help customers use  healthy community hadoop consultants systems integrators help said
open sourcing hardware too
interestingly just software operating systems starting open source hardware designs  probably recent phenomenon drive new businesses just potential reasons
just week facebook announced new open source rack switch make available open compute project facebook kept technology  company sees value giving design community letting build improve it
matt corddry director hardware engineering facebook says open sourcing tech makes sense gain developing open hardware platform able catalyze broader set discussions hardware industry gather feedback wider set thought leaders order improve designs obvious familiar world open source software large scale datacenter operators continue operate closed confidential hardware platform said
corddry says saw practice developing open source storage component called openvault number experienced hard drive architects attended talk tilting drives rapidly service events cause damage time based feedback updated design testing plans ensure controlled tilt rate drives properly production design better result said
even little bean openness drive innovation
as fellow techcrunch writer romain dillet wrote  page thesis power open platforms said little bit openness help means large company controls project lead tremendous innovation create hundreds new companies
if doubt look android danny sullivan search engine land  commentary google android open use  potentially better closed apple ios world  clopen  better way descri android closed open time sullivan wrote
in spite seen hardware software companies make money developing phones apps score android platform
sometimes simply opening apis allowing companies build platform drive type innovation want great example look salesforcecom countless companies building businesses based entirely platform simply expanding businesses taking advantage platform large number salesforcecom customers example financialforce erp solution built salesforce got m funding earlier year springcm content management company solutions built platform scored m funding earlier year open source kinds systems create new businesses attract vast amounts venture capital
for smaller example kevin fleming head developer/community outreach bloomberg explained simply opening financial data apis end  inviting companies build applications bloomberg information  party applications based api available online app store
of course lots open source projects really organized fail number reasons companies opened apis little traction building party applications reason  clear open source project open api gains widespread use community grows companies begin bubble platform happens produces kinds startup energy
all energy feeds eventually companies building applications utilities plug ins companies build products independent software vendors notice develop practices platform help customers implement solutions cycle feeds vcs come board fund new projects know you’ve created rich startup ecosystem
