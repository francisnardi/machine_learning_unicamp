one critical metrics software companies   difficult measure  lifetime value customers (ltv lifetime value dictates company spend marketing sales dollars
unfortunately early stage startups struggle measure ltv long consequently seen large number customers lifespans product
most software companies calculate ltv critical related metric customer acquisition cost (cac using following formulas

 measure way early startup estimate customer lifetime value best way this
one innovative techniques i’ve seen created redpoint portfolio company founder vik singh ceo infer vik innovation using rolling sales marketing period estimate ltv cac i’ve asked vik explain approach below
if running startup like key problems standard formulas determining ltv cac
while helpful investors use traditional calculations (for example year growth spend divided following year number new customers generating comps industry benchmarking portfolio publicly traded companies kind generalizable formulas accurate forward looking inform internal decision making run business
as company executive access detailed numbers la crm accounting systems  possible build advanced forecasting models derive metrics
however i contend need rules thumb  computed effortlessly ca improve ca measure right consistently monitor key saas metrics  nimble increasing ltv decreasing cac
so i came easy compute does depend closed sales data forwarding looking better addresses attribution gap let go…
the thing need cost opportunity say spent  million sales marketing (fully loaded  including salaries month june created  opportunities month cost opportunity june   assumes short opportunity lag time common saas world  use prior following months calculation sales cycle longer
next want determine expected (as probabilistic terms cac using opportunity win rate average deal size fluctuate historically win rate  percent average annual contract value (acv  ecac work follows
 
if divide ecac average acv derive payback period (in months  time recoup growth spend acquiring customer case
 
the customer pays months renewal (assuming annual contract bad related payback compute return investment (roi subscription period example
 
and know (or think acv appreciate  percent (so  percent year acv  decimal form customer renews year expected roi years subscription works follows
 
to compute ltv need estimate years typical customer stay years using actual sales data know  conservative based companies space (ask investors!
let assume year average lifetime  based assumptions annual contracts (versus month month service forecast ltv follows
it years know actual renewal increases renewals happen annually … probably wo press hard renewal increases just year earliest customers
you try analyzing industry comps determine good target just  conservative remove appreciation assumption reduces complexity formula (it  k *  estimated customer lifetime = 
finally let  divide eltv ecac using eltv value  dividing ecac k  company health perspective andreessen horowitz expects good saas business (x good
ask saas executives cac likely cite number previous quarter year  ecac based number opportunities generated recently (whether closed closed provides guidance current sales pipeline
another great thing technique adjust rate changes figures (ie decrease average deal size increase opportunity win rate decrease lifetime value impact say lowering pricing scheme look like
of course attribution opportunities growth spend perfect  better outdated cac used saas companies i’ve worked approach calls forced make assumption far better size fits formulas given investor community
with methodology saas entrepreneur compute key saas metrics time frequent useful guidance business create competitive edge letting read predict monitor advantage market dynamics faster startups  crowding space
