while bigid planning sell fact security solutions bb customers they’ve got grips data assets figured want to lock stuff sirota couches platform preventative solution  sense selling organizations visibility radioactive needs attending comes customer data holdings
what found… particular point view best interdict particular activity companies differing point view…  common just need better understanding knowledge risk best track compliance says
so time going customers  need  better understanding posture privacy personal data protection then… option figure secure good lot easier sell
the founders background identity management  including sirota having sold prior startup layer  technologies ca technologies worked ca head security strategy years  begun working idea bigid fall
today announcing  million seed round their platform market slated aim launching september investors round include enterprise focused seed funds genacast ventures boldstart ventures deep fork capital
right sirota says are in talks companies start running pilots started beta testing
so exactly bigid be able surface relevant risk data customers sirota says core tech big data mining added algorithmic secret sauce
we primary data sources  databases   technologies crawl data sources number years secondary data sources like logs dmp data management platforms essentially perspective information resides attributes information terms long it touched dmp explains
from bigid platform generate dubs kinds maps users identity map/identity graph risk profile map usage view/activity view data getting accessed
essentially big data solution  specificity personal information adds traditional solutions data discovery high false positive rate  leveraging fact organizations sources definitive authoritative information you…  crm  directory  relational database  start leverage essentially bootstrap system
so start zero knowledge start specific knowledge algorithms essentially expand additional copies information expand additional  just instances  additional attributes
the bigid platform  offered premise solution team envisages  majority customers (larger enterprises  sirota says does plan offer tool cloud service for smaller businesses that do want manage platform themselves
we creating another database personal information says asked customers trust bigid handle data toolset use think private cloud run internal datacenter gives better visibility understanding risk compliance
