ge new smart street light early production hopes time cities party developers will begin advantage platform build smart city apps
the light super efficient led  years gets interesting ge including sensor pack bulb capabilities video light weather sensors and giving cities developers access predix internet things software development platform to build applications based data sensors generate
as ruh vp global technology director ge points lighting division ge oldest businesses  company recognizes the shifting market wants capitalize changing mindset smarter efficient lighting technology
there currently test cities using lighting today san diego jacksonville
it used  generating wattage visibility  today product potential  explained light pole power networking adding sensors things lights everywhere
this means cities can potentially advantage data generated sensors using ge predix platform begin building applications for public safety transportation intelligent digital signs and environment
the cost traditional lighting drain cities towns account  percent municipality electric ruh said explain why cities towns looking ways cut budgets actually turning street lights decade claims new smart street lights save   percent electricity standard bulbs savings new lights pay  years
part efficiency gained led lighting technology  benefits intelligent run effectively pure lighting perspective smart light use sensors brighten dim needed turn depending conditions like traffic weather forth
what really separates lights run light bulb pack sensors ge provides  weather sensors video camera traffic parking violations forth
as example the video sensor generates visual data apply application rue said count cars plan transportation use video for public safety purposes
we essentially provide data sensors developers want build applications the city cost savings applications depend use ruh explained
if wondering privacy implications video camera light pole ruh says city set policies data collected sensors  used he adds that citizens say policy
there companies offering individual applications cities smart metering video technology according ruh  believes ge separates offerings providing complete platform build applications single place
he understands many cities use streetlights platform power digital signs ones highways making announcements road closings encouraging text drive ge cities tap power networking  they can communicate predix cloud generate content based conditions (such impending snowstorm water main break
ge makes power plants wind turbines equipment generate electricity  inherent tension inside company when comes creating highly efficient light bulbs generate electricity ruh admits there heated internal debates  company recognizes needs react market simply protect existing businesses
there matter changing business models need replace light bulb   years company needs figure different ways make money ruh says reason sensors app platform company can generate recurring revenue from the data collects or through revenue sharing with third party developers believes begin revenue gap created selling efficient bulbs
 early days type experiment just cities operation long way to prove viable business argue need electric powered lights just small solar panel pole let light pole generate power
ge clearly searching ways monetize predix platform finding ways modernize long standing businesses transforming an older company like ge huge challenge and the company working lot fronts smart light just one attempt
