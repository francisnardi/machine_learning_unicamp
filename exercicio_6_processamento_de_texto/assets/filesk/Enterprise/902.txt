autodesk sees solving problems d printing way add value manufacturing customers looking for ways use new technology in product creation process fact lot difficult problems solve approach autodesk hoping help coming up with clever solutions acting as resource their customers
to end launched project escher to help deal with a sticky d manufacturing problem limits single nozzle approach printing complex parts difficulty is that you can push material nozzle reach physical limit corey bloome hardware lead autodesk explained
the answer overcoming single nozzle barrier surprisingly simple just add devil details coordinating nozzles turns sticky digital problem autodesk hoping help solve project

the challenge making sure nozzles crash harder sounds fact complex programming exercise to make sure does happen
project escher study of sorts speeding d printing process providing fastest output possible took hours days reduce timing dramatically speed issue real challenge manufacturers keith kmetz covers d printing idc explained
project escher provides brains multiple tools work tandem multiple sources working object time exponentially increases productivity entire combining efforts multiple tools work job way address perceived speed drawback  case coordination (the brains software multiple printing sources said

the printer manufacturers struggled search for ways overcome limitation says kim losey product marketing manager autodesk big industrial companies spending tens thousands dollars developing d printers specific applications use control systems (project escher allows compelling product sell quickly said
autodesk is suited task says tim caffrey senior consultant at wohlers associates firm tracks industrial d printing space autodesk sees d printing additive manufacturing (the terms used interchangeably larger digital manufacturing ecosystem software autodesk sells key enabler digital manufacturing ecosystem explained

the like shift business making software design products  autodesk does way trying look corner see what future manufacturing could look like
this not necessarily pivot looking manufacturing business and going play role customers future we look ahead years try come market products solutions help  problems losey said
and lest think far ahead curve designed underlying architecture  flexible possible technology changes software adapt
we design anticipate leave openings things ca bloome said rightly points vision gets blurrier look tried build flexibility compensate for that
