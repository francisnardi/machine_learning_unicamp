red hat recognizes changing face enterprise computing involves containerization technology end announced beta release linux container platform called red hat enterprise linux atomic host
containerization new trend offers efficient faster way deliver applications virtual machine technology sense it another step virtualization takes concept strips produce greater resource efficiencies faster deployment
today beta release step providing enterprise ready containerization stack red hat enterprise linux atomic host platform build container technology releasing beta mark coggin senior director product marketing platform red hat says allow isvs build certified containers run host platform obviously customers confidence containers using built work advantage red hat platform course companies build containers well
coggin says idea build container contains application run time libraries a stripped version linux deliver core services required run application coggin says stripping linux delivering fashion makes portable easier deploy simpler maintain manage
he says designed compete the popular docker container technology fact working docker using docker platform release includes google kubernetes support gives users access important orchestration layer manage container lifecycle coggin pointed working google months kubernetes early days  adds important management piece stack
what instead hours stand physical server minutes set virtual machine set launch container  seconds coggins said companies looking greater agility speed gives ability react needs lines business instantly tremendous advantage today increasingly competitive environment
and just speed containers efficient design stripped instead average  vms server  containers huge difference terms cost run data center
coggin notes today beta release does allow multi host orchestration today supports single host implementation takes away efficiency achieve deploying multiple servers  says early release red hat plans offer multi host support future release did say   said  coming eventually
