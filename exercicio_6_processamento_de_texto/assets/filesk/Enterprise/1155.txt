david perry thinks secret agricultural challenges like drought resistance lie bacteria live bunch grass beach
that just example indigo company analyzes microbiomes plants produce seed coatings impart various attributes looking way combat difficult conditions various crops indigo launching today having raised  million in financing course life
we’ve  attributed things plants increasingly understanding characteristic plant do with genome plant genome microbes perry said we’ve taken tens thousands of plant samples  continent antarctica extreme northern latitudes tropic isolate microbes grow sequence  microbial sequences live plants
one company goals helping plants use water efficiently big issue drought stricken areas increasingly includes california  conditions  worse world perry said climate continues change likely problem exacerbated said
increasing crop yield increasingly important population continues grow  short need food perry said  potential motivation for these experiments backlash use things like insecticides plants perry said analyzed correctly  way produce plants insect  pest resistant use microbes help assuage consumers buy produce yielded through indigo coatings
the actual process coating seeds pretty simple exists meaning company use existing technology produce seeds seed sprouts takes microbes incorporating internal environment perry said ends improving crop yield business implications  indigo build real company farmers improve overall business theory least
the area microbiome analysis  increasingly interesting space startups working analyze human microbiomes like ubiome hopes improving health does make sense eyes scientists  startups  shift food supply hopes applying similar learnings improve yield

after figuring kinds microbes present plants company applies algorithmic approach determine ones probably yield traits like drought resistance tests plants seed coating based micro profile lab field trial indigo seasons field trials testing north america south america
perry te background pharmaceuticals chemical engineering figured that apply knowledge agriculture theory perry said modern technology  like herbicides pesticides  improving crop yield unintentionally destroying microbes plants decided identify microbes add plants impart traits make hardy difficult growing conditions
to  sure competition looming larger companies like monsanto spending real money area perry said startups focused area  advantage indigo starts microbiome plant soil perry says doing indigo does screen millions microbes soil plant perry said doing hit rate higher determining microbes produce certain results said
still seasons  determine process actually work long term   lot variation growing seasons indigo expects launch products year perry  specific kinds crops company focus primary goal product  improving plant yield water stress high production crops
the really interesting thing value proposition for farmers consumers perry said right tech is available like pesticides insecticides farmers help increase profitability yield things consumers want food puts farmers weird tension hand trying make living ultimate consumers like methods
