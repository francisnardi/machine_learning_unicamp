mesosphere bought orlyatomics database technology company today appears  straight talent acquisition deal orlyatomics engineers will  mesosphere te immediately  no terms available
mesosphere based open source mesos project wants build datacenter operating allows companies operate web scale inside datacenter achieving greater efficiency possible using traditional datacenter management techniques orlyatomics highly scalable database technology face the two like perfect match  surface lot common think mesosphere founder ceo florian leibert told me
first roots open source written c++ means orlyatomics personnel come hit ground running as they incorporated mesosphere te  just compatibility leibert said programming skills important  understanding scalable databases so
managing things scale managing state distributed systems scale talking inherently difficult explained said guys orlyatomics brought unique desirable set skills worth noting they did actually buy orlyatomics intellectual property although of course they access open source project patrick reilly ceo orlyatomics says look ways incorporate technology mesosphere database project play vastly different role
we love vision graph storage help people envision new creative uses data  building capabilities primitivesand course plans orly open source database running mesos reilly explained
regardless leibert said mesosphere was interested te ability work expertise actually built product directly applicable  experience gained building valuable it really organizing disorganized states big distributed said
since written c++ mesosphere believes orlyatomics team can learned building product and apply mesosphere products working low latency high throughput values rely massively scaled said
and precisely intrigued reilly te love high performance c++ hours diving areas wanted meld code orly mesos i’m really excited help create world apps consist thousands specialized containers running dozens datacenters coalescence behave like massive computer said
leibert added they started talking orly team  weeks ago  hinted they working company weeks that determined  good fit adding orlyatomics employees mesosphere  employees small group like especially important new employees fit in
leibert said evaluated way new employees bring liked saw
reilly said te excited by scope mesosphere project bring engineers love challenges challenge ambitious ridiculous building operating scale datacenter moment started exploring mesosphere codebase felt just like home said
for mesosphere bringing te felt meet long term goals what saw expertise really needed specifically road map build operating the data center type abstractions need build data coordination needs  class citizen working leibert said
orlyatomics open source project originally started social discovery site tagged reportedly m users worldwide born need massive scalability precisely made it appealing mesosphere
