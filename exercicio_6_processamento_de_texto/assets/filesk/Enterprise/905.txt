what happens technology company drug company try come unique new ways understand parkinson disease end project uses sensors body home provide continuous measurement patient symptoms impact person daily life impossible right now
trying track parkinson symptoms difficult today vary widely day doctors patients periodic basis says ajay royyuro director computational biology center ibm research makes kind meaningful measurement disease challenge patients doctors researchers
to compensate doctors ask patients symptom diaries   spotty subjective ca provide complete objective picture individual patient particular set symptoms dealing disease daily basis
that ibm pfizer come experiment experiment right place sensors home body individual giving continuous stre data  collected compiled sort data dashboard make sense onslaught information progr like produce
pfizer role drugs used treat disease today dosage art science trying perfect dosage pattern day impossible continuous assessment goal experiments te create progr allow flow data patient medical te provide pinpoint dosing
we opportunity potentially redefine think patient outcomes / monitoring combining pfizer scientific medical regulatory expertise ibm ability integrate interpret complex data innovative ways mikael dolsten president pfizer worldwide research development said statement
for starters experiment place ibm research center plan build experimental apartment complete kitchen bathroom bedroom living room begin testing different sensors space working people parkinson healthy people provide clear view range people react kind measuring
while sensors living area signal activities like entering room opening cabinet forth body sensors provide precise measurements person activity given room
the hope eventually experiment lab ideal sensor pack cost effective easy set maintain large number houses succeed conduct real clinical trial pfizer help set administer
such trial just involve the sensors  requirements clinical trial royyuro explained goal  just monitor symptoms  measure set therapies work combined monitoring tools
the solution scale  robust deploy patient home simultaneously hundreds thousands homes explained
ibm strictly altruistic sees business opportunity involving big data analytics cloud internet things  ultimately improving lives people technology
i think real opportunity make difference lives patients i seen close contact family member parkinson i effective  real time symptomatic measurement helping make lives better said
