i’ve writing about the enterprise long time day when i covering content management forever talk busting content silos putting content work company nice idea  practice rarely happens
what i learned week i attended the cloud identity summit san diego identity stuck silo separated isolated close cousin security
we long way to departments disciplines companies moving direction
trying make cultural shift
certainly ping identity ceo andre durand decade understands security identity way talking talk security identity different worlds different groups people  mission said
we trying drive security identity way saying need bring common quest  clear close making happen
it worthy goal course durand right track  attendee pointed security guys right entire conference dominated people deeply immersed identity  problem exists isolation
it expert silo problem people areas expertise talk folks similar way thinking tends make self fulfilling prophecies talk language believe things  right
yet hard miss  breach breach driven identity theft  hackers work malware social engineering techniques steal credentials simply walk door network wreak havoc security identity clearly closely linked problems groups tend work separately inside large companies  network folks separate group altogether
resource allocation problems
the problem course having single view universe people tend conferences like listening days think center enterprise world smoothly just care identity content management topic happens   way companies work course
what reality political budgetary process vying finite pool resources set departments i suppose  surprised working together common company good
executives like ceo cio ciso supposed pull set company goals define enterprise common good  reality tends  fragmented tough convince c suite fact identity security worthy significant investment say marketing sales product development
as participant told suggest identity needs fixing risking wrath ceo  wondering spending money years like think executives understand security identity sides coin forever shifting target game security chess white hats black hats good ill  executives lots constituencies satisfy  magnanimous
that unfortunately leaves political wrangling means siloed behavior i like think executive knows problems solutions linked multiple disciplines look organizational chart set individual departments operating separately  interwoven linked group people working good company
i would like think  reality silo problem persists forward thinking executives (and vendors ways tear pushing direction  talking identity security or any piece intertwined in the company mission
regrettably close vision yet
