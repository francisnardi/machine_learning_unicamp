if you’ve run k road race know race organizers spend lot effort volunteers milepost telling runners time like you’ve probably sped marker strove beat personal best time
the key lesson information leads better result sales management distance running share quality frequent information performance drives measurably better result end i reminded recently i read jason lemkin blog on inevitability moving monthly quarterly quotas saas company matures
i’ve spent career running sales organizations i think lemkin picked great timely topic blog worth reading i did slightly different thoughts conclusions i’d like share form questions reflections
why quotas ca i just pay fixed percent bookings  it
sure  does just like running k race runners near goal speed matter tired sales people way break quota sell harder work longer quota carrying sales reps work harder millions sales reps past century proven this
does length typical sales cycle affect smallest unit time quota attached it
absolutely! selling prospects dependably  closed  possible daily targets activity weekly quotas bookings
 saas prospects usually convert faster prospects software licenses big upfront payment things equal software does usually week close cycles
i hold weekly hour reps review forecasts ca place setting monthly quota
here problem alternative sales reps derive significant compensation meeting quotas care factors affect compensation
unless unusual clause company sales compensation plan places heavy portion compensation forecast accuracy sales reps pay little attention meeting forecast put that attention beating quota instead salespeople treat forecasts red tape actually resent spending time forecasting business
for sales compensation plans  effective need  aligned behavior business wants reinforce monthly quota driven compensation plans force reps care lot monthly targets achieve them
underlying discussion desire smooth bookings quarter why important techniques customers close earlier
there multiple benefits smoothing revenue important predictability successful financial exits ipo worth noting easier high p/e ratio business dependable consistent growth erratic big swings bookings
 ipo earlier business closes time period (month quarter year better chance making target time period monthly quotas set realistically motivate sales reps smooth bookings support business overall revenue goals
what techniques jason lemkin blog post suggests giving sales reps discretion offer bigger discounts business closes early quarter saas business gross margins inherently healthy that
it certainly true monumental discounting seriously affect gross margin percentage saas business metric watched closely investors type business
however broad discounting lower asp time lowers size served available market market company going huge  fine average customer buys  appropriate
 company expects lots expansion business prospects early discounts unnecessarily lower future price customer willing pay limit size resultant cash flows substantial good thing
if i set  quota targets year just lot work me
no venture backed business i know yearly operating plan plans set budgets bookings revenue expenses month figure quota assignment optimal street disaggregate number reps
and holding weekly forecast calls talk going hit bookings number forecasts add time day use monthly quotas versus quarterly
the blog suggested monthly quarterly quotas inevitable business grows inevitable
i believe i’ve seen companies transition quarterly monthly grew order improve confidence sales forecasts reasons listed particular networking company i know uses monthly sales quotas generating billion dollars bookings
are types businesses would not use monthly quotas
sure i business deal large complex rep work time (eg government military contracts deal variables multi faceted sales cycles   years business probably  improved monthly bookings quota i  unable think single saas business characteristic
if running saas business want grow large predictable business closing business earlier quarter highly desirable goal sales management  tasked  driving monthly bookings quota reps paying monthly goals cause switch behavior month end indifference mild annoyance rapt attention focus beating goal
do you’ll soon celebrating (and business wins sprint finish line month just quarter
