mesosphere silicon valley startup based open source apache mesos project announced m series funding today
the funding round led andreessen horowitz help from data collective fuel capital follows seed funding year ago m  from andreessen horowitz kleiner perkins foundation capital sv angel
the company wants change companies manage resources servers inside datacenter based on the open source mesos project by essentially allowing pool the computing resources a datacenter as single machine distributing resources efficient manner (as graphic illustrates
according matt trifiro svp mesosphere possible of  containerization technology developed google building google concept  mesos allows administrators to complex applications run scale and use resources entire datacenter as single unit using containerization isolate processes
as trifiro explained this markedly different from virtual machines break single machine multiple smaller machines allowed administrators run applications organized manner using entire machine said approach worked applications relatively small  got bigger complex machine matter smaller machines sliced longer sufficient
cloud applications run scale actually required resources machine single container approach lets use resources require  mesos production number companies including twitter airbnb ebay netflix actual implementation remained highly complex required skilled engineers implement
mesosphere co founder florian leibert says saw opportunity simplify started mesosphere  products developed tool called elastic mesos lets administrators create fully running mesos cluster amazon cloud just steps simplifying highly complex process
 trifiro says wo stop bringing level simplicity management target platform premises/private ubuntu redhat debian private clouds like openstack public clouds like amazon web services google compute engine digital ocean said
what regardless underlying platform fault tolerant machine inside cluster fails long available resources mesosphere product will simply transfer machine intervention human personnel
the underlying administration tools let add different elements web server web cache hadoop cluster traditional datacenter tools  spread multiple servers highly inefficient manner wasted server capacity (as illustrated picture above
mesosphere fills space server starts adding applications additional server space job running requires certain of  server resources will fill available resource capacity server simply starting available one
mesos originally developed phd thesis by benjamin hindman et al university california berkley leibert working twitter discovered research brought hindman on board help solve twitter infamous ‘fail whale’ problem servers pushed capacity twitter simply stopped working displayed fail whale graphic twitter open sourced code  apache mesos project
leibert says company product works large small companies alike simplifies highly complex activities allows datacenter regardless size to use its personnel computing resources efficiently
in addition elastic mesos products including marathon large scale orchestration deimos docker integration
