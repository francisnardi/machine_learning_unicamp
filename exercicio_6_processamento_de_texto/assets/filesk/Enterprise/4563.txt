google play skies april swept and acquired titan aerospace amid reports drone maker was pursued by facebook  google interest hardware companies provide primary sources data ending google closing deal skybox imaging satellite company specialises recording detailed landscape pictures video techcrunch heard different sources
google skybox reported april information reached advanced stage weeks ago meeting rounds acquisition talks source tells people satellite industry started hear rumors google eyeing skybox startup working similar area satellite imaging planet labs
we heard deal skybox happening person estimating price roughly  billion source said skybox fundraising round picked  million  valued  million  million
google declined comment story skybox did respond techcrunch requests comment
so might google  interested skybox areas skybox imaging  companies like   attractive search giant
the data google consumer mapping services
currently google uses mixture sources google earth real world imaging component google maps images are more date are years date having primary source data updated regularly provide reliable accurate set data google potentially expand consumer focused products services
the second data google bb business
google a business division called earth enterprise provides mapping data large organizations institutions businesses google earth enterprise allows store process terabytes imagery terrain vector data server infrastructure publish maps securely users view using google earth desktop mobile apps application using google maps api division notes home page
this be a significant company enterprise push  significant enough that news case studies division feature prominently on google general enterprise blog
a constellation small imaging satellites like place today rapideye skybox future google reliable rich content source imagery analytics related applications scott soenen cto satellite company blackbridge said says company planning generation small superspectral satellites ramp imaging capabilities further
in cases signs interesting trend google company continues mature increasingly exploring lines business tap future current bread butter search related advertising
that important just diversification believe search ads decline as dominant force in digital advertising prominence couple years maps organizing data in physical world clear extensions google core search business
a area skybox conceived company founded  julian mann dan berkenstock ching yu hu and john fenwick startup gone way figuring commercialise data provide simple data sources configure companies commercial satellite industry done
skybox looking far downstre approach people have successful soenen says regard google appears be interested just data  talent figuring interesting ways using it
but! there are caveats to skybox information heard worth noting explain bit state play satellite business moment
the target heard google interested making play satellite imaging company  number companies using small satellites technology record earth terrain fit bill
they include blackbridge has a business called rapideye provides wide scale images large landscapes covering  million square kilometers ground day week it picked  million funding expand business satellites urthecast creating video streams happening below
planet labs backed likes dfj yuri milner founders fund  others has deployed nearly  birds  calls doves  continuously record send images earth while companies like blackbridge urthecast producing data complementary skybox planet labs direct competitor seems
there companies looking opportunity omniearth week announced partnership harris corp draper laboratory dynetics deploy  satellites cover  earth day
this generate  petabytes scientific quality earth observation data annually feed generation big data analytics lars dyrud president ceo omniearth said statement planned satellite constellation provide platform users need high quality analytics friendly imagery automatically extract commerce environmental information make predictions
given initially rumors google  looking satellite company possibly planet labs skybox it could  that there intentionally inaccurate information spread to throw people off trail google really  pursuing
the second caveat skybox itself
we’ve heard different sources company raised  million date number investors include khosla ventures bessemer venture partners (disclosure crunchfund founded techcrunch founder michael arrington investor need raise money soon does make exit
that building launching satellites  small satellites skybox bases business  pricey game cost make device potentially running millions operational launch costs bird factored (relatively speaking small numbers satellite industry types devices likes blackbridge skybox planet labs often referred low cost
jp morgan among the financiers that we’ve heard mentioned context raising round spreading reports company play google  advantageous current investors looking good valuation company company looks new backers
and it turns satellite game pricey  dicey too
skybox existing data comes single bird currently orbit
it recently order  devices  built space systems/loral set launch /  immediately plans launch second satellite by the end june think june date kind deadline skybox source told exit getting financing round place
satellite launches typically place secondary passengers larger spacecraft launches larger spacecraft getting partly fully funded government
in case skybox plan send second satellite piggybacking launch soyuz vehicle scheduled baikonur cosmodrome kazakhstan  fully controlled russian government
in wake sanctions russia tensions ukraine  the us state department april  said bar exports possibly retroactively satellites to russia contribute russia military capabilities  there have lot question marks launches baikonur would  affected
spacenews reported earlier month canadian satellite supposed piggyback soyuz launch as skybox bird barred canadian government from doing citing ukrainian situation
skybox declined comment spacenews impact political tension russia skybox commercial satellites  government included commercial launches past restrictions in the case of launches from china
the launch situation complicated  insurmountable india has successful launch progr commercial options spacex notes soenen blackbridge handful options for a low cost satellite launch
the one satellite skybox does capacity as soenen puts  able constellation  producing interesting data beautiful just beautiful another industry source described me
in words google does end buying satellite business   high step long term bet data rich map filled future
