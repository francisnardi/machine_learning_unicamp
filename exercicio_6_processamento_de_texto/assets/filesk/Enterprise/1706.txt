traditional enterprise storage dying slow death
the bulky old school storage boxes filled data centers large businesses symbolize past era modern data center undergoing tremendous transformation hyper converged systems open source software defined storage large cloud scale storage systems companies assemble transformation created need business agility fueled software
let decades
the concept separate san nas storage box outside server/compute created better utilize storage capacity centralized model provide better durability reliability centralization enterprise data
and widespread adoption (emc symmetrix fueled commoditization high speed internal network
over period time storage got tons features durability reliability and scale simply got expensive bloated
and key trends threaten existence storage know virtualization cost operations simplicity convergence cloud
given trend data center  billion storage industry look like  answer question examine changes underway data center 
storage seen iceberg comprised primary storage main memory needed run active applications deeper secondary storage does directly interact applications typically secondary storage used primary storage replication involves holding secondary copy data secondary storage also refer cloud storage druva cloud bringing flexibility managing workloads enabling convergence backup archival compliance companies need run separately
cloud + convergence compare cloud storage traditional storage cloud related benefits clear cloud storage allows access data time carrying physical storage drive company moves workloads public cloud amazon microsoft example pays resources uses workloads moved cloud translate storage needed better cost efficiencies mind hyper scale cloud providers buy storage established storage vendors build there also are open compute initiatives projects help companies assemble cloud based storage systems themselves
also traditional storage setup requires purchasing servers storage network separately cloud erases problem companies buying servers storage network data center building block converging convergence make traditional storage obsolete idea buying storage independent core architecture dying
in addition cloud convergence forward looking storage models gaining momentum  enterprises solid state drives (ssds expensive compact power efficient traditional electromechanical disks drives use memory chips instead spinning platters store information moving parts drive ssds smaller longer consume energy software defined storage (sds storage managed software layer software manages policy based provisioning data storage management independent underlying hardware
meanwhile software service (saas gaining momentum  enterprises means manage backups saas offers cost savings terms personnel hardware physical storage space network administrator example specify data network  backed sign service level agreement (sla stating saas provider rent storage space cost gigabyte stored/cost data transfer basis
if saas/sla model bit cloud consumerizing storage let use iphone analogy install new apps iphones apps just storage space needed app apps consume additional space storing documents data games pictures videos storage consumed apps apps important hardware itself in coming years storage  like iphone  consumed application slas
basically pay service work application just like iphone camera functionality use various photo video related applications iphone new cloud merge various services slas single consumerization cloud storage business focus managing infrastructure contain hold data building services bring value leveraging massive volumes stored data available
looking data center  things change today burden allocating space buying hardware apportioning application storage integrating managing multiple products support data storage shifting environment services delivered cloud storage platforms shift suggests convergence primary secondary storage allow businesses focus strategic benefit applications building complex advanced applications
