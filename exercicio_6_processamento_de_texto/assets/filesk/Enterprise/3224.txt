you probably know ‘big data’ mind heading  you hearing constantly vendors journalists alike (guilty charged know hype says right big data going provide all answers make companies run efficiently help make brilliant data driven decisions organization sharp competitive edge
to extent true  like like hyped technology companies implementation hard reality different hype figured out effective ways collect process data  putting work make better decisions matter companies finding key missing link big data big understanding way resolve  left big pile confusing data insights
as one silicon valley insider told recently while big data collection processing gotten lot attention lately terms startup activity funding huge gap expectations results person big data translated big knowledge big insights big wisdom estimation ways happens
separating hype reality
we want believe getting value big data simple pouring data running progr getting insights  fact complicated p baker is author book data divination big data strategies says actually clear cut instances data points direct answer  case
data definitive answers many cases example predictive analytics accurately forecast airplane water break dictate exactly replace maximum use old  old actually breaks baker explained
 added cases ca definitive answer  choose possible actions choose action just depends working said
baker right data driven decisions subtle require bruce springsteen sang just little human touch people can help developing sound metrics powerful algorithms figure make best use data telling straightforward  not
the expert gap
further love believe big data business users direct instant access data make best decisions magically fly unfortunately tools today not offer that level sophistication just yet
to help resolve issue need data experts help process data answers vast amounts information keith rabois investment partner kholsa ventures invested big data companies parstream says companies need data scientists role conducting sophisticated analysis average line business user just capable doing
rabois says want data scientists creating applications algorithms doing heavy data science lifting  companies actually data scientists  time partly spending time doing sophisticated analysis does advantage skill sets
rabois says best case scenario data scientist developed tools help distribute  analysis organization  different parties require answers want day age need answers quickly create guru bottleneck expert answers wait results
the problem smart people develop highly sophisticated algorithms  definitive answers complex problems simply possible to factor option or account certain factors that difficult measure
find good center fielder
if want good example look baseball similar players paper produce different results stat geeks tell you that algorithms created years called sabermetrics provide information you need identify good baseball player particular role created range like wins replacement (war statistical measurement according fangraphs defined player got injured te replace freely available minor leaguer talented player bench value te  losing measure difference wins using complex set criteria
there little doubt sophisticated kinds metrics help compute value players accurately  ca measure like plays pressure hard practices kind leader gets teammates things matter harder quantify
people believe pure statistical measurement tell  measured true  i’ve seen cases players look similar paper particular role nearly player spite statistical similarities
applying business human resources professionals could encounter analogous situation candidates open programmer position similarly skilled professionals vying for job  people skills work workers  surly difficult poor communications skills intangibles going resume lot data difficult to take account possible outcome especially comes people
consider nuance medical diagnoses
any good doctor tell patients identical symptoms likely require different treatments based individual variables person age weight health issues additional unique factors
consider use ibm watson intelligent analytics platform medicine i explained friend recently doctors using watson help diagnostic treatment decisions bristled did want machine deciding medical treatment valid concern  case watson does answer like trained seal physician blindly follows offers options based evidence knows patient symptoms current research matter (not unlike physician actually works
as i pointed busy doctors ca possibly job bit research fields simply (and good thing watson comes filter current research doctors faster people possibly  level requires nuance understanding physician decide exact treatment direction i like art science knowledge takes far  final arbiter physician machine
businesses likely going face similarly unclear outcomes people step use training make choice help data
where here
machines answers insights taken people years figure baker points instance big data helped answers diseases cancer human researchers thought look appropriate treatment (or years big data information point big data  pretty darn accurate told me
what believes machine learning reach level sufficient sophistication distant future machines  making decisions simply brains ca possibly available information
she probably right  ability collect process data gotten ahead understanding means baker noted predictive analytics improving time data points straight answer  remains complicated mix human machine comes work progress technology marches forward
until balance tips sharply favor machines face big wisdom gap will take time technological advances fill
