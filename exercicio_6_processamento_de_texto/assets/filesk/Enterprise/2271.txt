aaron levie box recently shared perspective on the trillion dollar market enterprise startups building solutions help individual workers broad job functions entire industries digital aaron argues that
as vc working startups creating innovations i argue far bigger opportunity address field office deskless worker operates field office represents people processes physical infrastructure create value wide range industries including manufacturing farming logistics energy retail  physical goods services created delivered
the deskless worker operates factory farm warehouse construction site  places people engage primarily physical goods instead keyboard phone
in  desktop computer connected ethernet took hold desk based knowledge worker office enterprises focused centralization productivity early  laptops mobile phones connected wifi cellular networks pushed digitization office allowing knowledge workers  productive car café client office
the era digitizing non digital achieving deeper understanding world impacts enterprise
digitizing field office
thanks major technological advances  internet things (iot wearable computing low power connectivity  wave enterprise innovators poised extend enterprise digital reach far corporate  offices field office value generated creation delivery physical goods services winners decade  companies create apps infrastructure connect workers smart spaces smart machines far office window
iot catalyst new opportunities created field office broadly defined set sensors physical world activity stre data enterprise cloud allows operational processes used  invisible  measured accompanying data  available immediately example firstfuel leveraging hundreds millions smart energy meters installed north america europe provide energy companies detailed analytics commercial customers generates opportunities send teams perform energy efficiency upgrades building important growth driver industry
as iot takes hold advances mobile wearable technologies connecting deskless workers new ways wearable computers allow hands free operations provide transmit real time data factory floor hospital floor repairing complex products field companies wearable intelligence augmedix provide solutions different types workers ranging oil rig engineers emergency room doctors enabling reliably follow procedures automate compliance recordkeeping connect real time remote specialists solve problems quickly
finally low power connectivity networks tie data stre enterprise cloud new distributed networks like helium samsara robustly information different types devices act gateway existing infrastructure
the trillion dollar benefit challenge
successfully connecting deskless workers spaces operate physical  (mostly analog assets use cloud providing real time stre data enable revolutionary advances time enterprise business running real time office office field office way point delivery customers inside customer opens door end end analytics business process optimization possible before
insights immediately  pushed field help workers jobs efficiently effectively safely data exhaust enable real time learning adjustment enterprise managing portfolio talent physical assets digitally example airware provides drone solutions survey mining quarry sites measure material movement air optimize planning tracking wearing hardhat
finally transformation enterprise connecting non digital infrastructure digital infrastructure recast enterprise contrast earlier eras today startups provide solutions address centralized enterprise traditional white collar mobile worker  integrate deskless worker physical assets digital ecosystem  win companies need solve problems greater scale higher complexity seen enterprise cloud today new developer tools data science platforms network management applications  created address challenges unique field office leverage extreme velocity volume variety data streams generated interactions iot deskless workers
it daunting challenge  entrepreneurs stand atop technology advances connect field office enterprise cloud  handsomely rewarded
