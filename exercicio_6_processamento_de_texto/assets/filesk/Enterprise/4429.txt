today facebook announced new modularized rack networking switch technology new linux os control switches company will eventually share technology open compute project
jay parikh facebook vp infrastructure engineering announcement gigaom structure conference interview derrick harris
parikh says effort way number years disaggregate (or break smaller components main parts facebook data center far it been able compute server storage  point company has been using traditional rack switches
today changed parikh announced new rack switch called wedge idea said break hardware software component parts modules making easy change company ultimate flexibility make changes needs change time
from configuration standpoint wedge gb switch  slots expandable  fits standard rack  pros swap components change way configure piece meet variety needs
parikh says makes wedge different way architected makes operate like server he says allow software developers hardware engineers greater flexibility design various components inside box fboss new linux based os that operate wedge
one lingering block network connected conventional manner buy box plug configure parikh explained
 parikh said using appliance approach really slowing looking solution provided control
matt corddry director hardware engineering facebook said breaking down into component parts gives software developers much greater flexibility manipulate different pieces hardware programmatically ways just possible old fixed appliance kind approach hardware just black box
what hardware engineers swap pieces chassis meet needs
corddry says company like facebook which has wide variety needs network  main facebook app moving pictures instagr chat facebook messenger (and comes road later  approach just gives tremendous flexibility configure different pieces network including rack switch meet changing requirements
corddry told company does date set release new switch open source  continue work today announcement beginning larger conversation community large
as prikh said facebook welcome input comes believes community make better cheaper faster use design company not wedded specifically design  time needs run business solve internal problems continue build flexibility data center shares open compute project
