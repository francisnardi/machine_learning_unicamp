cloudphysics vision data center wants sysadmins clarity insight possible issues create bottlenecks virtualized environment offer solutions happen and help prevent issues happen  cloud service
and  jafco ventures giving company  million series c funding continue work joined prior funders kleiner perkins caufield & byers mayfield fund latest round brings total funding  million doubling previous contributions
in addition funding announcement company announced release latest version cloudphysics platform enables sysadmins predictively troubleshoot storage problems a virtualized network
john blumenthal cloudphysics ceo founder says company has been working new release year deliberately chose storage data showed storage big pain point customers
the beauty cloudphysics approach says gives data center employees single view problem instead having log multiple systems try piece problem problem laid visually explanation happening to fix it
the company uses data entire network customers combines data it collects each individual customer data center build big data collection information use help make predictions data center behavior presenting visual manner (as example above
blumenthal says approach generates social aspect highly visual nature information helps traditionally disparate teams storage networking nature problem fix  cases really understand te does
it laid blumenthal believes long way improving communication resolving problems virtualized environments quickly predicts it usher age data center generalist people longer  confined narrowly defined areas expertise data provide information instructions need proceed understanding nuances piece
he said the system help sysadmins decide given workloads requirements investing solid state drives bang buck justify investment
blumenthal says data center simply complex generates data today humans help like are all emitting immense amounts data is tons data exists without model understand layers come vendors created not a way ahead it
to illustrate cloudphysics claims collect b samples day t date going grow gather customers partners parties using platform
while blumenthal says highly influenced companies like new relic appdynamics likes doing he says does necessarily competitors they are delivering information developers higher stack
he says people like compare splunk sumo logic  does think apt comparison companies deal unstructured data index search cloudphysics deals structured data presents information directly user
blumenthal said storage piece just beginning hope eventually tools analyze entire data center platform built allow customers partners parties build tools hopes happen time
