the latest rumor microsoft community confusing microsoft disable default metro defined start screen desktop based computers windows  currently referred threshold
according neowin brad sams in threshold builds users manually turn start screen back  situation dependent wish access live tile environment
zdnet mary jo foley slightly different situation
all makes sense let synthesize we’ve known things time microsoft wants prioritize desktop windows environment talk post pc world people wildly dependent trusted computing configuration and windows going  unified discrete screen environments eventually functionally dual version operating works phones desktops
i doubt microsoft disable start screen pcs desktop focused  does mean company build flavor core operating desktop experience greatly favored
here reach point dissonance microsoft hellbent building share windows store resides metro windows x hell afford essentially push section operating aside actually proper concession windows store icon moved desktop operating system
and run metro apps desktop environment ahem windows store days needing start screen
anecdotally i know means speaking skewed sample set i’m recently seeing folks life purchased windows x pcs enjoying new form factors touch  enthused using start screen chronic basis make merely i’ve noticed heard
foley interesting thought
