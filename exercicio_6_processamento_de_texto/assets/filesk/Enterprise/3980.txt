let face hp king silicon valley  years company has issues due the revolving door ceo office company finally gained stability meg whitman lack consistent leadership resulted in shifting priorities changing strategies and the products famous lost some shine process hp clearly wants regain glory and is trying hard make today proliant server gen update hardware upgrade company wants  notice ready innovate again
peter evans vp of hp servers global marketing goes far say just product release strategy  years says means just optimizing servers  optimizing business outcomes technology level means updating servers latest generation haswell chips  evans points doing just series linear incremental updates driven latest technology intel
with latest upgrade hp provides the obligatory chip updates course  said it went step it wants ease load data center managers make simpler cheaper run house age cloud offering pool resources managers scale needed cloud fashion
it hopes bring agility economics cloud house he claims new generation proliant servers does just lowering cost square foot kilowatt of running servers and he claims new servers offer x improvement previous generation proliant servers competitor offerings
secondly hp working hard reduce time takes jobs it wants automate possible reduce number clicks complete job instance claims server upgrade hours days complete large server farm  reduced seconds upgrade huge efficiency improvements process instead upgrading machine serial fashion says upgrade cascading fashion servers upgrade simultaneously
finally hp wants improve evans calls value installation giving customers the information operate efficient manner instance reducing number license needed used
patrick moorhead principal analyst at moor insights & strategy sees hp goals genuine hp mission change server market trying market homogeneous heterogeneous servers focused specific server applications  tackling new storage networking workloads hp gen line holistically doing just  server need look entire line classic rack blades moonshot apollo new products  coming moorhead wrote in email
this focus business value certainly improvement businesses today care benchmarks probably little relationship happen data center  care focusing business problems solutions likely looking vendors solve problems simply check box technology update cycle doing time
the problem hard make bold statements hp is certainly talking good game hardware software combination described sounds bold innovative ready rock data center martin hingley analyst candor england says players saying thing and hp quite innovative wants believe
i’m talking server players new intel machines lengthy preliminary slides just chip announcement hp leading x server provider hardware player trying catch integrated systems  cisco dell winning  workloads  ibm oracle kings hingley explained email
 analyst moorhead sees generational leap just marketing hype hp actually delivering early promise application specific servers i look proliant gen moonshot apollo factor i’m expecting big things place really need shore appliances better meeting server needs largest scale datacenters increasingly buying odms (original design manufacturers like quanta hp working hard fronts
all means hp level innovation debatable  clearly making sort pivot hingley suggests just catch competitors
however hp still controls good chunk server market leap forward trying  hardware player certainly help sustain lead age cloud server commoditization
evans says industry debate servers matter really relevant argument focus needs  firmly customer finding infrastructure matters the ‘is server commoditizing’ question irrelevant thinking the incremental generational approach based chip advancements longer server customer needs
