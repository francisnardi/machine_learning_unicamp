big switch networks facebook ntt announced today come create unified operating system called open network linux open compute project‘s (ocp switch hardware
while does exactly roll tongue the project designed help companies web scale type companies like facebook looking advantage open compute project open source switches use platform base configure switch forwarding algorithms (more minute in way makes sense them
up project consisted set disparate components engineers stitch open network linux helps bring components flexible way while removing some engineering complexity
the project began  months ago big switch networks contributed the beginnings switch os to ocp switch os complicated beast kyle forster founder big switch explained involves big components the platform code and forwarding agent said hardware switch itself ocp design originally contributed facebook
without getting technical platform suggests base operating code configure various components make switch panel led behavior  environmental sensors fan drivers forth  gets interesting according big switch cto rob sherwood engineer begins building base code designs forwarding agent component helps define switch interacts network
this companies begin differentiate themselves once platform code written stable engineers tend expect work  forwarding agent matter we’ve seeing different idea packet forwarding agent sherwood said
today announcement means build piece to liking plug stack partners  big switch networks facebook ntt  demo ability time later week box included reference forwarding agents facebook open switch (fboss from facebook l routing from ntt openflow big switch networks
these reference components give engineers work begin build agents future contribute open source project proprietary sherwood explained
as bit background facebook moved buying hardware creating created open compute project (ocp began contributing designs underlying software project project facebook rack switch known wedge
the idea ocp fold good corporate citizen sharing learned creating web scale hardware broader community but in doing facebook engineers outside company ideas thinking contributing project too
big switch networks came help companies interested ocp hardware  did skill personnel install implement it in organizations
this admittedly complex stuff  core comes fundamental open source projects are designed help companies build solutions on open source foundation open source code provides starting point engineer does reinvent wheel yet each build modify fit
this project is no different
