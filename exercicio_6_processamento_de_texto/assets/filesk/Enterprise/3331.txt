we told follow data truth  revealed  data tells tales depends data and interpret it makes wonder definitive present similar sets of data draw wildly different conclusions depending emphasis data tool hands humans interpret choose  clear choose  deliberately deceptive  probably true human bring unintended biases data
it huge conundrum age big data definitive answers look different data points topic come different interpretations
data scientists matter
p baker author book data divination big data strategies looks data science perspective  acknowledges ask right questions good answers
data pulled according relevancy precise question asked data algorithms written include inputs identified necessary answering question baker explained email
she says data scientists number tools at disposal work  mistakes  possible  room error course  data science statistics hammered issues long big data came   true wrong data points used algorithm data flawed way algorithm output (answer  wrong flawed too
that useful far goes  we know shortage data scientists i’ve heard vast majority companies is all data  companies lacking expertise help understand data  manipulated answers want
i listened speaker earlier week at gilbane conference boston bunch statistics that suggested people did use apps fewer than  suggested  percent users did mind receiving sp sms messages coincidentally worked company offered sms advertising solution shared a bunch data suggested  foolish build app wanted customer attention
the speaker followed displayed data point that indicated download  apps minute fewer  apps time  downloading apps pace clearly conflicting data like makes hard answer questions definitively suggesting old axiom ‘lies damn lies statistics  truer imagine
lines business face data challenge
and data hands people data scientists as baker recommended dicier especially folks marketing trying use data products services best possible light worse if try to draw conclusions markets based bad information
scott liewehr president consulting firm digital clarity group says real danger told marketers have  willing hard work build valid studies  using bad data make bad decisions direct company resources everybody use data tell story want tell big challenge marketers liewehr told know run studies make lot bad decisions
baker agrees  says folks line business add value know markets better data experts putting could produce better results marketing sales people understand better data scientists ask  important diverse data te said

data  clear careful
last week i ran story looking popular enterprise sync share tools based study run  research highly reputable firm ran not  studies months apart publishing research clearly careful methodology i’m casting aspersions  article i wondered asked right questions right people instead looking usage generically asked specifically enterprise licenses versus consumer licenses would seen different picture easy figure imagine i learned researching this article
first all the  research data  percent respondents reported using dropbox giving commanding lead enterprise finding i reported i surprising box cloud poster child enterprise market listed fourth  percent responding used box  data does necessarily tell story
consumer licenses ones us can buy service offers certain storage free willing pay example i terabyte dropbox account for  year contrast business enterprise license comes variety tools help manage licenses organization provides access product apis build solutions base product tie enterprise software (a feature dropbox released just week
ilya fushman head product at dropbox business told week dropbox recently passed  business customers (some small businesses larger number fairly impressive consider launched product april  interestingly comparison box tells  business customers  numbers tell story box pretty big customers
for instance box counts eli lilly toyota dreamworks comcast md andersen glaxosmithkline  clients recently sold  enterprise licenses deal general electric add schneider electric with   licenses  procter gamble begin to come different conclusions  research study enterprise usage difference total number customers
for record hard know just customers dropbox wo share seat numbers  large reference customers include large brands hearst hyatt mit news corp list number smaller customers dropbox business site
alan pelz sharpe  research analyst helped author study says working methodology and data reported just start long process analyzing market
the october survey data i think revealed number things  firstly dropbox huge footprint companies (no surprise   particularly competitors market immature  growing clip enterprises reluctant embrace public cloud options trends  interesting time  release new survey information really going  value  changes time  added fact doing detailed market revenue modeling space new dimensions emerge wrote email
data does great value course  careful possible come to ambiguous interpretations trouble nailing answer because even data we gaps obviously you have  sure data based solid questions produced accurate information follows best data gathering practices  possible to produce unexpected outcomes proving just following data  simple sounds
