containerization
 year docker emerged open source containerization standard   contenders to throne  dockerized applications production environments significant opportunities exist start ups provide persistent high performance storage layers enhanced security policy management efficient network interoperability optimized scheduling monitoring  web scale architectures create opportunities new cisco oracle microsoft vmware emerge  entrepreneurs note
convergence
vmware enabled enterprises gain significant savings reduce complexity server consolidation  primarily windows based applications
today enterprises running wide array different operating systems applications built public private cloud platforms virtual machines new application packaging technologies (amis containers start provide foundation decoupling software hardware
 nutanix is great example converged solution initially built virtual desktop use case layers software defined compute storage networking underway  lots places target specific workloads reduce cost/complexity improve performance/security
database domination 
after taught years structured data  relational database data warehouse application developers adopting range new data platforms
hadoop nosql clearly emerged preferred approaches analytical operational workloads respectively companies like couchbase cloudera hortonworks mapr and mongodb are taking market share incumbents
however appears  early realization number common (and distinct access patterns data relational/sql document/json caching/key value analytical/columnar search/inverted metrics/time series files/hdfs multidimensional/graph new wave data analytics companies formed exploit opportunities
hybridization
businesses sizes wrestling leverage iris capabilities range existing solutions enterprises evaluating alternative approaches migrate replace legacy business applications infrastructure  want strong security policies access data early hybrid cloud use case pioneered storsimple (acquired microsoft azure entails archiving data cloud enterprise storage gateway  new idea bring storage (byos enable corporations leverage existing public private cloud storage feel comfortable data privacy controlsmassive analytics
combining new data platforms new massively distributed systems technologies enable companies store process billions data points near real time recent successes business intelligence like tableau and qlik  native analytics visualization solutions hadoop nosql emerge
the application complex analytics (and real world simulation models  applied functional areas like sales marketing hr common business processes recruiting budgeting/forecasting ultimately specific vertical industry domains like retail manufacturing financial services palantir is just example successful application leveraging new platforms massive analytics   more
