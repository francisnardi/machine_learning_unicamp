editor note saty vaghani founder cto pernixdata silicon valley based enterprise storage startup
sports fans excited final fours  new te playoff college football semi finals competitors wimbledon famously remaining competitors ncaa basketball march madness midst year tournament i started pondering fab final world impactful storage patents date
this quite competition college basketball march madness starts  teams  game field  million patents issued patent trademark office  years okay i clue patents involved storage  safe say number thousands
i picks based pretty simple criteria patents represent truly great game changing technology innovation led significant business success companies invented  sexy  define sexy storage world
so break bracket sheets think younger soft spoken dick vitale i present patents changed enterprise storage (in particular order
 patent  granted to data domain in  
data domain silicon valley company founded start st century clear mission disrupt backup storage market cost effective disk based substitute tape
in days secondary backup storage exclusively tape based tape hold data cheaper using expensive disk storage hold backup data companies did need access daily basis sense
then aug   data domain announced patent trademark office granted patent entitled efficient data storagesystem invented ben zhu hugo patterson chief scientist kai li casual sounding title belied revolutionary innovation deduplication
deduplication identifies removes redundant data segments high speed allowing organizations reduce number backup copies need make similar files store file times different directories data domain invented way figure duplicates store file once
the technology leveled playing field making disk storage cost effective replacement tape worldwide argue set stage emerging technologies like cloud based backup going tape  network disk data domain patent fundamentally changed world terms data backups place
in  emc acquired data domain  billion
 patent  granted netapp in 
netapp set solve problem disks efficient write data sequentially disks read data sequentially disks  disks excruciatingly slow writing reading random world behaved applications read write sequentially
netapp david hitz michael malcolm james lau byron rakitzis way eliminate need store data metadata predetermined locations disks called write file layout wafl voila! sequential/random problem solved
an important feature wafl ability quickly create snapshots read copies file allows users recover files accidentally deleted business continuity event data loss wafl productized snapshotting primary function enterprise class storage systems flash arrays threaten wafl dinosaur status exceedingly important technology evolution storage netapp its name disruption flash caused by wafl relevance best lessons perils resting past achievements
patent  granted isilon systems 
like patents literal systems methods providing distributed file incorporating virtual hot spare moniker game changing advance storing file data  multitude smart storage units accessed single logical file system
as company press release time said core data protection feature… dynamically recreates data free space isilon iqstorage cluster eliminating need idle additional storage units servers spare disk drives  dramatically reducing cost complexity customer storage environment
this patent invented sujal patel paul mikesell darren schack aaron passey led isilon ship practical distributed storage  probably successful commercial product class time
distributed systems software hard engineer number components idiosyncracies needs handle folks isilon wrote file specific hardware mind highly simplifying number corner cases needed handle good engineering lesson good engineering making practical product meet demand necessarily perfect product  years good engineering iterative good products  great time empirical usage data
emc acquired isilon   billion continued update core technology hadoop new demands
 patent  granted vmware 
obviously vmware pioneered concept partitioning physical computer virtual computers  company virtualize x architecture (patent geeks  interested know early vmware leaders scott devine edouard bugnion mendel rosenblum filed patent number   virtualization including virtual machine monitor computer segmented architecture  oct   published  
 vmware developed patented technologies advanced storage capabilities (full disclosure i personally involved patents cto vmware storage group
patent  example describes vaai lets virtualization platform convey virtual machine operation storage meta level storage vm operations internally efficiently involving servers patent  invention led vmfs  clustered file world does require server server network communication work need plug shared storage
 patent  entitled computer accessing object storage holds significance future storage opinion created myself and vmware colleagues (ilia sokolinski tejasvi aswathanarayana sujay godbole patent enables storage systems store operate vms class objects
it allows scsi nfs storage morph vm aware storage patent foundation virtual volumes vvols just introduced market vvols closely matches requirements virtual machine underlying storage bringing storage virtualization age
there happening storage world today remains unclear patents stay spots emergence new approaches like decoupled storage example need arises storage intelligence servers increase vm analytics manage resources effectively end i’m thrilled store future
