it sunday let stretch legs little bit earlier today julie bort business insider wrote interesting piece detailing rapidly approaching end game storage wars prices consumers businesses pay cloud storage racing zero forcing new jockeying inside crowded industry
it trend underway google ripped cap email market offering gigabyte storage gmail cloud providers box dropbox offer business customers unlimited storage microsoft does extending offer lower paying consumer subscribers
and storage offered consumers pay continues rise inexorably  lines cross  eventually cloud storage needed size come stapled business consumer accounts provided large cloud companies incentivized grow lock  developers users  cost just showing up
that easy let step cloud computing power eventually  free ubiquitously cheap price wo  far zero current free tiers amazon aws microsoft azure cloud computing platforms equivalent free gigabyte gmail price compute skyrocketing downwards
the large cloud players  microsoft recently checked google amazon competition scale space  pouring billions cloud platforms building capacity world knows building  certainly track usage prices falling want increasing usage prices decline i’d suspect creates even negative price pressure competitive landscape pulling levers
in cloud storage large players are working to build apps storage stack unique value proposition price of storage finally reaches nil cloud computing  value add large players use compete be their app environment build say google app ecosystem cloud compute might  free google app ecosystem best you’ll want work  google did offer competitively priced cloud computing smaller players use advantage potentially hem google business
so compute prices  pretty uniform industry falling near unison course precisely seen cloud storage prices
i’m going say happen certain date  major platforms continue distinguish define cost compute keeps falling competition developer attention only increases offering value services end  weapon available all
the race zero awesome
