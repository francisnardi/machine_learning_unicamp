until recently i knew enterprise security widely publicized breaches united states
that said spending  immersed space i’ve come appreciate just challenging broad issue security  enterprises
i’ve come believe best hope solving security understanding humans  perpetrators victims cyberattacks  result i’m convinced security fundamentally human identity problem
human beings tendency things technology original intent inclination  celebrated technology continues drive radical innovation form new applications use cases platforms
unfortunately type behavior makes security difficult problem individuals organizations leverage technology intended unintended uses  virtually impossible foresee threats vulnerabilities surface process words issue enterprise security nature reactive asset  fully secure
economic theory highlights security  problematic explains market buyer/seller dynamics
an obvious takeaway rsa  market  incredibly saturated fragmented enterprise security companies  incumbents challengers alike  claim offer nearly identical solutions collectively crowd handful themes (eg endpoint security leveraging machine learning buyers base decisions established set signals  satisfy compliance checklists address underlying security vulnerabilities
the saturation fragmentation herd like activity symptomatic uncertainty governs market forces security i think leads irrational buying selling behavior slew offerings practically market segment exists near figuring best protect enterprises
buyers willing pay ineffective solutions midst massive breaches sellers continue champion product infallibility marketing brochures unsure products ultimate value
so abundantly clear single silver bullet enterprise security we’ve reached point taken aggregate apparently hundreds thousands distinct silver bullets unusual economics suggests occurs buyers sellers operate environment extreme uncertainty
cloud iot complicate issue altering expanding total enterprise attack surface
on cloud traditional (and clearly outdated approach security involves single enterprise firewall encompasses entirety organization infrastructure approach largely obsolete companies embrace cloud assets longer centrally housed structurally isolated
not  increased adoption cloud applications companies face unprecedented levels ip data identity sprawl enterprise firewall frequently touted cloud evangelists (ie distribution assets creates nightmare scenario security professionals
on iot influx connected devices entering iot ecosystem exponentially increases ( number entry points exposed breaches ( permutation paths attackers exploit arrive targeted assets
the notion existing endpoint security solutions effectively mitigate iot borne risks hard accept connected things design different desktop mobile devices iot hardware software come shapes sizes traditional endpoints absence standardized protocols deployment today makes difficult secure assets iot ecosystem shift verticalized applications use cases suggests standards are put place  somewhat federated industry specific
also iot devices face limited resources incompatible endpoint antivirus solutions market compatible existing offerings security professionals deal lion share devices currently run legacy operating systems unable support cutting edge technologies
yet makes iot single biggest security risk generation attacks longer constrained assets foundational value iot lies bridging physical digital divide attackers target operational technology (ot cause actual physical damage
again humans inclination things technology original intent possibilities endless hackers recent attacks targeting control systems physical assets (eg  vehicles power grids hvac systems dams steel mills scratch surface  possible future attacks  carried organized crime groups exact injury death
none come news security professionals know space i (and probably i’ve observed organizations security defined largely operational function turn leads reactive incohesive decision making
these dynamics  institutionalized point established religions security include
relying entirely religions secure enterprises dangerous attackers threats constantly evolving tactical decision making effective extent guided overarching unified enterprise security strategy
so companies think approaching security broader strategic level address question worth emphasizing that
the recurring theme countless moving parts enterprise security natural corollary point challenge dynamic committing technological organizational financial resources specific tactic counterproductive  bound fail it’ll  matter time major breach renders approach ineffective
there element remains consistent  despite uncertainty governs market forces recent advances it/ot infrastructure human beings   ones carrying cyberattacks
notwithstanding varying motives approaches pursued attackers   rogue actors corporate insiders industry competitors organized crime groups nation states  operate constraints dictated human tendencies behavior
with said i’d like argue security really understanding human beings shortage attention incorporating advanced technology security solutions i’m bullish innovation sake innovation i feel strongly advances helpful extent shed light attackers behave inside outside enterprise
this means addressing potential insider threats company needs visibility employee contractor customer access underlying assets growing mindshare around identity access management (i encouraging trend goes solutions focused exclusively application layer
because identity longer abstracted infrastructure networking components enterprises able achieve visibility provision assign manage privileges seamless (and hopefully automated fashion entire stack
to effectively address external threats means enterprises rely solely blacklist attackers vulnerabilities  reactive gets   proactively scour entire threat landscape identity attackers recognized patterns behavior threat intelligence starting address challenge i’m optimistic solutions systematically profile contextualize attackers level granularity achieved before
while role enterprise security invest promising products technologies biggest takeaway months security technical space  better profiling understanding attackers making problem fundamentally human identity
