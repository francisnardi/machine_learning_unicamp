snowflake computing came stealth today announced m series b funding hope modernize data warehouse creating cloud based system that process structured semi structured data single giving customers believe be the best worlds
the funding led redpoint ventures sutter hill ventures wing ventures sutter hill funded seed round series a the company   just emerging today announcing funding product
the product snowflake elastic warehouse cloud based service calling data warehouse service data warehouse concept actually dates the s when companies as financial services credit card companies starting deal with lots data coming relational databases needed way pull data various systems to make reasoned decisions early systems required tremendous resources help to pull took years build expensive build maintain complicated run requiring experts help formulate queries generate answers
snowflake saw opportunity modernize concept by reducing the complexity and putting thing cloud takes hardware equation users access much compute storage resources need reasonable price does not build maintain system in data center
end users worry loading data running queries scale meet needs means limited size data stores need dbas help  snowflake did stop there
ceo bob muglia said old data warehouse relied relational databases neat rows tables  today data mix structured data semi structured data instead making customers choose tools process separately snowflake built database process types data single system
it bold time companies looking open source solutions choosing way process data and building a solution on instead snowflake went its own way built scratch muglia says wanted processed the types data structured semi structured required building own database accommodate vision
the result single product understand types data provide answers queries little  minutes instead hours days old style data warehouse snowflake stuck older concept data warehouse latching large data set buzz word du jour big data partly care size data set users provide little data wish snowflake process them
