as you might be aware microsoft support windows xp expires today which means company stop issuing security patches around  percent ignored warnings using stubborn bunch you
conventional wisdom suggests security patches business users  foolish continue using xp lest  victims viruses malware potentially cripple businesses
 really case
probably just microsoft stopped shipping patches does mean antivirus vendors stopped supporting xp fact quite opposite mcafee symantec kaspersky shows have pledged continue support xp  now
mcafee says it’ll update its software xp for long technically feasible so symantec says it’ll update xp foreseeable future  means kaspersky specific saying it will continue support xp the current version future updates bets off
the fact need  thinking transitioning away from xp matter attached xp might  antivirus vendor stops supporting playing net want  doing that
i realize companies years customizations links programs built xp i hear you chanting mantra ai broke fix  point simply bite bullet windows 
given general disdain windows  metro style tile interface understandable want users probably know know  likely not make smooth transition entirely new way working tile interface entail
it going  difficult likely expensive end make sure works latest version compatible software you’ll spend fair training employees new ways working matter version windows choose
you  able inevitable  need start planning future xp need  doing soon antivirus vendors vague length support end point
you able away ignoring warnings  ounce common sense realize point good luck run smart need start transition soon  really late putting business risk
