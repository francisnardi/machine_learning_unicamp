google brain an artificial intelligence machine learning project google used power services like android speech recognition photo search google+
now longstanding machine learning engineers worked google brain left search giant start new company idea build machine learning artificial intelligence technology similar used internally companies like google making available cloud service that be used anyone
scaled inference startup called stealth does website ( eventually  inferenceio and scaledinferencecom
an angellist profile lists founders olcan sercinoglu (first started work google  and dmitry lepikhin (an year google vet worked projects like sibyl widely used products like youtu google play notes notes startup has raised  million seed funding investors include distinguished google engineers georges harik and gauth thambidorai felicis ventures amplify partners tencent david wallerstein tencent itself others
contacted startup sercinoglu tells quora ad d’angelo  backers seed round likely   million closes hunt for engineers flesh business
there number notable departures google brain  called google brain drain person i spoke described andrew ng original founders leaders project left coursera earlier year joined baidu quoc v le thought left well
other googlers deep learning object recognition image classification expertise left facebook ranks social network artificial intelligence project consider companies like apple ramping search clear demand market deep learning expertise
for sercinoglu actually second time left google  worked startup called imanen focused intelligent mobile applications adapted based user interactions sercinoglu says imanen ip transferred scaled inference
sercinoglu and lepikhin chose build project startup google stayed work it
we opportunity exact project google says willing acquire ip imanen let work  i just felt  great opportunity to build company like this to sustain itself
it case hard feelings sercinoglu history doing thing at university built a music search engine called avfindcom longer running  project helped catch google attention
i’ve  tendency build thing long i stayed google speaks great google is
while startups like deepmind (acquired google vicarious (still independent significant backing focused long term problems human level ai imitating human brain machines scaled inference based idea takings concept effectively making neutral platform different kinds problems
(here analogy if think individual ai applications vertical specific search engines scaled inference positions google world artificial intelligence
scaled inference positions differently companies believe ai company  able provide useful services sustain itself along (very long path advanced general ai sercinoglu says ultimately ai does need imitate humans an airplane needs flap wings
scaled inference provide ai as cloud service  virtually kind machine learning and ai  used the web apps particularly built creating services based individual users particular context  location browsing history else
mobile apps created smartphones small screens people particularly suited idea doing legwork users companies like linkedin trying tap specifically consumer facing services
big companies using machine learning ai long time new  visible sercinoglu notes like power new generation apps intelligent context sensitive
there  areas scaled inference platform apply example application sercinoglu released imanen called river aggregated user various feeds facebook twitter learned rank items according probabilty user interacting  unlike facebook moderates feed days
river capture your intent reduce features  fed ai ranking items read according probably engaging sercinoglu says river built to run devices idea ip cloud
when launched scaled inference  based set apis  released launch
the set lowest level sercinoglu describes  pattern reognition submit data start recognising patterns start alerting patterns anomalies says
another will let developers predict user actions based questions answered (something imagine apply customer service surveys example
and third will  ranking product based basic functions existed river (think service apply site like quora example people search information help rank results
quora has house solution ranking search results  d’angelo investing scaled inference company looking scaled inference creating
the platform fact  built ai mind offer sets apis and goal make simple and intuitive says need descri problem  mention methods use systems  able figure based have
