mesosphere commercial entity built open source apache mesos project announced major milestones today starting with m series b funding early release calling data center operating system
the round was led by new investor khosla ventures additional funding from andreessen horowitz fuel capital sv angel unnamed investors latest funding brings total investment date m
besides funding bigger news announcement of data center operating (dcos new kind operating that operates scale entire data center means instead controlling single machine operating system sits data center enables administrators treat resources data center single virtual entity allows simpler management lets administrators spin servers software needs require quickly current methods
the virtual machine allowed make best use resources single machine  mesosphere wants concept step allow apply principle entire data center today applications tend work multiple servers no matter ways break single machine resources just going suffice anymore
by applying this virtual machine concept entire data center create single pool resources manipulate way like  powerful capability administrators what this ability virtualize entire data center dramatically speeds time takes spin server clusters days weeks hours minutes depending large cluster trying create
the virtual resource pool designed span thousands machines fact mesosphere mentioned reference customer running  nodes dcos believe scale  nodes by the end year
administrators operate dcos command line use graphical user interface to quickly drag drop resources library command line panel  gives administrators the ability start multiple instances software library quickly library includes popular open source products default as apache spark apache cassandra apache hadoop google kubernetes or customers add internal software packages

dcos is compatible versions linux including redhat centos ubuntu coreos public cloud infrastructure services companies like amazon google microsoft finally use private cloud infrastructure services including virtual machines bare metal openstack
administrators set triggers a scheduler tool certain conditions met automatically run pre defined set commands instance administrators run set commands based cost job run cost threshold were met what administrators advantage api build applications single pool data center resources available from mesosphere dcos
mesosphere said dcos will  generally available year  early access progr now
