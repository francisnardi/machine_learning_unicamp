there certain ways doing things in hardware engineering engineers simply follow rules use fighting them even wanted frankly think it because just given  recent tour facebook hardware lab director engineering matt corddry says facebook scale requires rethink old rules let engineers imagine outside industry standards
since facebook begun building hardware means engineers rethink things build equipment scale facebook requires creative thinking understand challenges costs operating environment needs better outside vendor able specialize specific needs facebook corddry told recently

corddry explained ways facebook encourages creative thinking engineers work specialties and talk i need engineers learning experiences optimizations break boundaries discussions disciplines said
facebook engineers work instead isolation interesting things begin emerge silo engineering teams server storage database forth we create these barriers said we bring different teams new ways solve problems
another thing companies hardware manufacturers fail bring engineers datacenters watch people maintain the equipment design taking  screws (or  replace hard drive need hundreds times year begin needs  simpler way
that designed disk array shown designed easy maintenance screws simply flip large green lever slide out the array pop small green lever hard drive need replace lift hinged lid (as shown tug hard drive pop new screws involved all and facebook scale need  thinking types issues

he said disk array design i looked iterated time make simple possible maintain possible yet
in contrast corddry told spoke hardware engineer unnamed vendor admitted watched technician try repair design think maintenance shows we’ve dealt equipment way small screws poor placement end bloody knuckles scraping inside machine fun
when dealing machines troubling dealing thousands tens thousands takes different dimension
another way facebook engineers thought outside box (literally server design corddry told engineers conditioned server design fit u rack  gave permission forget imagine design server rack limitations
when left limitations opened kinds possibilities left design devices engineers came long narrow box facebook designed rack accommodate new size afford facebook box slides rack slides screws pictures engineers laid box different parts glance hardware engineer friend looked pictures pointed design principles hold terms sit memory relation cpu distance want information carry  facebook allowed engineers break design mold felt right
corddry said idea specialists narrow deep focus broad generalists hackathon style approach let design problems really come creative ways solve difficult design problems
it worth noting producing unique forms hardware open source open compute project where designs are delivered to a community designers attack the scale computing problem figure ways produce hardware easier maintain runs efficiently  managed cost effectively its lifecycle
