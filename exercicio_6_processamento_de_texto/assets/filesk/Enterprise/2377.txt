at point companies mature face build versus buy technology decision
a company like facebook encounters that kind choice constantly  / timeframe extraordinary one
it growing faster just company planet having issues keeping scale decided start designing hardware building data centers meet company specific needs
at that time facebook purchasing equipment usual channels placing leased location facilities  finding commercial equipment reputable manufacturers flexible meet needs jay parikh vice president infrastructure engineering facebook told techcrunch earlier month
parikh charge developing software hardware infrastructure runs facebook spoke candidly challenges choices company eventually it was significant decision involving major investment changing way entire company worked
yet facebook was able make transition remarkably fast  looked back
the company reached build buy crossroads essentially accident growing quickly constantly running obstacles result growth having impact business
we having slow products features business did performance characteristics needed shelf components parikh said
we having slow products features business did performance characteristics needed shelf components jay parikh
as facebook grew required getting hood equipment making changes  nature proprietary equipment extremely challenging the company debug different things people written and deeper got process harder  understand lowest levels infrastructure
we kept going path buying stuff making work  error prone flexible costly hard troubleshoot explained
it point company build decision
in / thing happened realization going  flexible perform  right cost structure order flexible control cost metrics forced build parikh said
once facebook was control destiny enabled the company approach hardware in completely new ways longer bound by old rules physical design equipment abandon preconceived notions engineers developed years provide standard way storing equipment company was designing and building racks equipment gave engineers power experiment rethink aspect design

and precisely it done facebook hardware lab director engineering matt corddry told techcrunch year facebook knows requirements better anyone
we understand challenges costs operating environment needs better outside vendor able specialize specific needs facebook explained time
since decision facebook designed range equipment networking rack switches enables company programmatically control equipment giving tremendous flexibility

at time facebook began developing software manage custom pieces equipment such as fboss agent software company created run custom rack switches
finally designed highly efficient spaces house equipment opened altoona iowa fall facebook looked aspect data center design cooled  using  percent outside air instead expensive air conditioning systems  electrical equipment racks housed equipment
after facebook began designing equipment data centers decision   to bring power community bear problem open sourcing just software  hardware designs launched open compute project foundation organization created facebook help share designs
according organization mission statement open compute project foundation rapidly growing community engineers world mission design enable delivery efficient server storage data center hardware designs scalable computing
it surprising statement ways mirrors mission facebook purpose clearly chance advantage facebook hardware designs goal advancing scalable computing helping facebook improve designs it situation everybody win
facebook started project  years ago recognized companies had similar problems related scale  efficient work wanted bring group share common set problems come solve parikh said
last year  engineers contributed open source projects facebook started  work facebook said
in spite speed facebook transition  mistake think did willy nilly facebook plan relied on data make sure achieving desired results macro level data embedded decision facebook makes parkih explained
when started path building hardware dipped feet parikh said designed built server did configurations started simplest design hardware perspective building web server
along lines built just data center grew there
the company constantly reviews data turns makes sense buy build does company constantly evaluating looks house expertise asks people know particular problem takes consideration parikh explained
we want empower technology leads data need drive parts business said
in spite decisions tests large scale transition parkih sound like big deal rocket science know strategy look data sounds pretty simple right
