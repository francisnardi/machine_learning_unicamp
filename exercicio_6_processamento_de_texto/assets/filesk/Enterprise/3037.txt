facebook revealed final piece scalable data redesign today completes vision redefining traditional hardware software make flexible meet needs facebook scale
to end announced new open source modular switch platform called  pack
the key piece understand facebook focused separating hardware software making of the fully programmable giving facebook flexibility requires
facebook plans contribute entire design open compute project engineers  free build configure design components fit
last june facebook began journey redesigning rack switch ( called wedge developing version linux called fboss run step separating hardware software key building the more flexible network required computing facebook scale
this enabled facebook treat switch like programmable server operating operate independently essential because needed separate hardware software network allow engineers deal piece separate programmable entity
 stop built data center future needed completely rethink network topology information moves network required creating entirely new data center fabric flexible deal facebook massive computing requirements getting bogged down
as frederic lardinois wrote new altoona data center fall facebook new approach entire data center runs single high performance network traditional clusters just server pods connected other
this led final requirement deal modular switches situated rack  fabric today announcement solves final problem introducing monster fully open modular switch based wedge like rack switch separated hardware software network given facebook total flexibility progr run it

facebook describes follows
you wonder facebook went trouble  believed needed build entire network scratch view commercial offerings just limiting speed scale company like facebook have
one things saw network industry was open matt corddry director hardware engineering facebook explained difficult expand grow technology commercial networking equipment did visibility control lot commercial approaches closed software hardware combined said
the option redesign data center effectively gives speed visibility inside equipment need develop tools quickly 
as putting resources open sourcing corddry says simply facebook vision scalable computing
fundamentally mission make world open connected secret mission hidden agenda just mission said
