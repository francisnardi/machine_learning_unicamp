what i told you visit continents day leaving office truly feel like person hallway stage make eye contact feel like human just face screen
earlier year paul mcdonagh smith  coworker mit sloan executive education based london  did just help telepresence robotics thing morning presented conference singapore alongside colleague cyndi chan business meeting cape town south africa later afternoon met te members mit campus cambridge massachusetts
if encountered telepresence robot look surprisingly humble variety appearance  basic elements screen functions head leg neck turning head set gyroscopic wheels traveling model use double robotics essentially ipad leg wheels simple technology quite remarkable bringing people together

in office telepresence robots longer novelty  everyday tool we’ve using enable remote te members  engaged thirds staff work remotely days week double robot units available regularly te meetings one visits paul experience  bit extreme use doubles quite like day
the majority like colleen berger executive education progr director lives cape cod hour commute office  good day colleen uses telepresence robot regularly join meetings conversations colleagues campus i use robots occasionally traveling logged plane enjoy ability  truly present interactions colleagues clients  experience feels natural personal phone videoconference
the daily operations mit sloan executive education te fall major categories developing facilitating education programs meeting faculty clients members business community traveling world professional conferences business meetings we’ve learned best internal uses double robots we’ve gradually  strategically  expanding office walls i mentioned use telerobotics internally  bringing robot classroom required lot thought just figuring logistics people
mit sloan executive education programs rooted shared learning experience  participants gather campus learn faculty build professional relationships mit ecosystem experiment virtual delivery select programs  underlying principle remains offer benefits presence remote participants compromising experience learners located classrooms benefit technology most
offering people distance mobility challenges like good place start wanted make selection programs available people consider enrolling  room benefit participation help right candidate pilot brought in disability diversity expert sean driscoll sean founder bbsquared consultancy advises organizations diversity equality inclusion initiatives
we worked sean context involvement work limits statewide network aims increase employment  individuals disabilities massachusetts sean deep knowledge disability diversity issues wide professional network instrumental experiment sean help met tom hershey entertainment industry executive lives works los angeles tom uses electric wheelchair traveling country presents set unique challenges him
tom attended day executive education progr managing complex technical projects led senior faculty members professor steven eppinger prior progr tom couple training troubleshooting sessions staff  expected participate just like  room got hang operating robot fairly quickly able enjoy aspects progr running lot fun i forgot fact honestly i remotely says sort caught activities happening classroom  like there
having attended mit undergraduate student tom thought experience robot approximated classroom experience quite lucky tom long career special effects technology sony pictures savvy user eager try cool new tech approach noted areas improvement  overall impression positive sense remote physically says needs bit work  i feel confident  good avenue
steven eppinger little nervous having robot enabled participant classroom key concern tom progr says i know possible interact robot technology i did know work classroom setting  actually worked quite smoothly tom fully able participate open enrollment progr  people everybody want opportunity speak class interact table did exactly things
steven considers personal interaction important overall progr experience  taught various technology enabled settings including online teleconferencing synchronous delivery preferred method
i think richer experience synchronous says  truly synchronous need gather physically mit use various remote technologies comparing telepresence conventional good videoconferencing presence certain things big advantage synchronous located possible break location requirement
as bonus steven did change thing teaches make allowances technology simple teaching room robots  entirely different matter room present digitally sensing capability  quite different require dramatically different method teaching
professor joanne yates agrees room robots does make sense thing telepresence robot gives physical presence interact human presences presence screen
joanne teaches communication persuasion digital age progr studies dispersed teams communications methods make effective opinion telepresence robotics offer important advantages traditional collaboration tools allowing remote participant join located group
the robot gives flexibility audio phone connection videoconference says voice actually comes robot people treat robot person usually picture voice coming point space robot big advantage allowing robot interact people class meeting
bruce hecht attended progr tom person  physical body electrical engineer boston based analog devices robotics enthusiast bruce thrilled participant attending telepresence robot  seated table initially beeline tom soon saw i heard i wanted meet i wanted experience like  i just like sit people different tables meet people i bruce took opportunity talk tom breaks lunch small group projects describes experience different working physical body
bruce regular participant mit sloan executive education programs building relationships learners important aspect progr experience easily traditional audio videoconference tools really  possible phone people wo know ask wo know ask says room lot people  people person really conversation time
the telepresence robots make possible remote person direct attention natural way  able shake hand (yet!  maintain eye contact talk turn look  table actual seat room physically present table lower ipad basically position seated people table eye eye says bruce
adding robot natural feel ability remote person communication styles super user paul describes  having one conversation  i quite naturally communication style i robot stage i present group    to kind collaboration broader communication style forth easily
the robot agility adjust different communication modes important aspect tom navigating spheres communication instructor class instructor student student workgroup student student key benefit technology says adding user sees area ripe evolutionary improvement
this kind natural ease just possible traditional collaboration tools like audio videoconferencing tendency kind round robin people turns speak paul explains wait host initiate discussion remote user lot egalitarian sense i participate robot i actually easily initiate discussion happens i  creating actively participating active participation key difference
paul points similarity double design face face conversation thing visible ipad person head   percent real estate similar human interaction perspective interact physically
however eye contact human like feature double range motion paul likens unit slight oscillation person shifting balance foot stand talk i think gives sense active presence like human embodiment says
another key aspect telepresence robotics level attention required person participating remotely ca multitask easily  and good thing colleen explains i think fall trap just phone tend multitask regularly option telepresence really  present  retraining work different way  end meetings productive collaborative participate add value probably receive value truly listening
the heightened attention focus just important classrooms experience executive education programs intense requires commitment time attention duration program
what telepresence technology given goes far initial plans make meaningful technological accommodations remote workers popular proverb necessity mother invention certainly true us
our motivation try technology came office physically remote space middle major city construction project near campus make notoriously frustrating boston commute thought long hard effective ways accommodate flex work te members
telepresence like intriguing addition proven highly effective te i’ve written spoken extensively boon flexible working arrangements employee morale job satisfaction productivity technologies telepresence robots helping make possible
now we’ve opened our classrooms robot enabled participants outside te learned experience continue look different ways using telepresence robotics campus beyond
