throughout history new technologies constantly changed way we’ve worked they’ve responsible scale revolutions continued investments come corporate demand worker productivity drives tech spending
we expect augmented reality (ar virtual reality (vr eventually attract increased spending enterprise combine new mobile network advancements make emerging trend called productive mobility reality
productive mobility productive office inside productive virtual instance physical one
consider boeing use augmented reality glasses streamline plane assembly workflows decreasing assembly time reducing errors  percent amazing just beginning reality transforming workplace future
that critical mobile network developments come exciting ar applications require instant environmental interpretation rapid delivery contextually relevant information functionality vr particular  stereoscopic video greatly raises payload overhead rich media
fixed mobile broadband network advancements like fiber g service provider centric content delivery topologies deliver higher throughput lower latencies new convolutional network designs patterns  previously insurmountable massive data sets enabling rapid intelligent predictions network things connected users engaging it
this opening new doors productivity information sharing enterprise
today typical network management sees supervisors tracking field technicians using wall screens field share streaming phone video  leaves precious resource  hands  unusable
a vr interface replaces wall screens massively expanded desk space giving supervisors seat insight techs experience remote feeds shared techs ar enabled headsets access tutorials checklists voice guidance visual cues supervisors collectively shortens repair times common issues information automatically displayed tech works repairs
experts highly skilled contributors need longer  physically present solve remote issues  precious knowledge scalable resource thanks application ar vr
it hard think outside box work ends screen edge network managers monitor large sets data assure performance services current work spaces cramped d screens computers keyboard mouse based input limit speed interactivity locating sharing right views collaborating  cumbersome particularly time sensitive crises
vr changes dynamic provides virtually scaled collaborative canvas lets teams work shared data sets spread arranged manner possible physical screens virtual hands manipulate data rotating glo identify geographical source issue voice commands streamline work flows allowing collaborators ask common questions access different network views perform complex tasks simultaneously drilling resources
