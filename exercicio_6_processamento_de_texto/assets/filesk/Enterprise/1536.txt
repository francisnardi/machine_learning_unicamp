data science applications healthcare finally trying catch rest world new effort coming from six year old apixio san mateo ca morning company launching a cognitive computing platform called iris that derives insights clinical data information health system
more specifically iris uses powerful data integration extraction suite pipelines restructured data machine learning model that theory enable its healthcare provider customers the ability better understand patient health
it easy draw immediate parallel apixio ibm watson health critical differences watson derives insights medical literature correlate symptoms outcomes iris platform uses doctors records notes
 

while data driven techniques medicine hardly new apixio target market historically little widely accessible information though doctors produce volumes notes patients handwritten data siloed healthcare records unavailable even newer electronic forms accessible difficult machines read rarely indexed
eighty percent of medical records unused technologies leveraged healthcare today says darren schulte apixio ceo
bob rogers one apixio cofounders chief data scientist intel adds that part problem typical doctor workflow turns doctors use codes work said dictate write to doctors
apixio innovation able operate workflow operation centers ability access undigitized data parse derive powerful insights natural language processing techniques tied machine learning algorithms
it big bet schulte explains customers decide want share data metadata help machine learning derive better insights short innovative potential insights iris   easily hamstrung large healthcare providers restrictive data
the good news years apixio built powerful network large healthcare providers scripps health healthnet wellcare kind rich data sets critical data science applications help iris fulfill potential provided continue share them
