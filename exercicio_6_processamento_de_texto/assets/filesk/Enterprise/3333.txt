others like facebook twitter mixed response requests countries services accessible (or sporadically unless private vpn tunnel companies refused remove offending material france twitter actually complied requests from governments involved anti semitism
important note github compliance comes resistance
  agree choices russian government respect country sovereignty recognize russians different cultural sensitivities company notes concerned internet censorship believe transparency virtue posting notices better inform public content withheld github post takedown notices document potential chill speech
it goes note takedown does mean agrees decision

the concern russia censorship laws brought force  violate freedom speech   abused effectively silence people speaking state
this particular note describing methods suicide interesting example lines blurry  written (particularly cynical funny satire  biting tongue methods   options include joining military getting good gun you know right policeman violating rules inappropriate suicide content  mocking authority
