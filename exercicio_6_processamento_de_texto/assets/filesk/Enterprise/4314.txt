for i key opportunities moc operational access understanding large scale cloud infrastructure growing skills areas rotate resources support consulting organizations so hand experience

 biggest advantage involved project like vendor perspective similar academic real data large scale systems like work probably interesting use case ability operational data large scale environment lot cloud services black boxes work vendors  the ability information inside large scale infrastructure said
holtzer added huge advantage making moc project operational data transparent visible
the fact lots cloud infrastructure options available  open marketplace people negotiate pricing access different pieces infrastructure a project like starting point offering open way selling infrastructure services moving forward
