scaled inference  startup founded two ex googlers building a cloud based platform parties want use artificial intelligence machine learning tools run apps services  raised round funding continue its development hiring series round  million from khosla ventures
this brings total funding  million startup raised a seed round earlier year number angels prominent investors like tencent felicis
while scaled inference launch public product expects working prototype soon and is bringing companies closed trial platform
in months raising seed series rounds scaled inference been putting products (or services that run platform pattern recognition anomaly detection prediction predictive ranking  accessible developers way set of apis
the challenge scaled inference building cloud platform machine learning intelligence  trying figure distil specific applications general purpose services set says founder olcan sercinoglu (who started business with dmitry lepikhin serve foundation various special purpose services plan offer future
these core services depend user supplied data set stre largely defines potential applications explains
for lot services focused e commerce related financial services
as example pattern recognition  applied says take a bank credit card company like visa visa feed transaction data like time location merchant customer item transaction
the pattern recognition apis  used detect correlations increased spending certain time periods certain locations certain customers certain items certain combinations attributes says turn type insight help guide important business decisions branch locations/hours regional marketing strategies pricing transaction fees on
anomaly detection apis  used detect unexpected events like large transaction coffee shop to single transactions geographic area customer usually based course types services large banks (or visa place  idea create services way small financial startups example  able execute similar anti fraud data inquiries
the prediction apis focus predicting attributes based other attributes example  spent particular region certain time period type precise predictive analysis  used optimize important future looking business decisions enable intelligent products services save users time predicting users want need ask explicitly says
the predictive ranking api related let users rank large numbers objects based predicted attributes example  used ranking items customer likely purchase certain time/location alternatively ranking potential customers given item merchant sercinoglu says addition shopping apps  used advertising systems sorting inventory
there potential roadblock scaled inference applying services e commerce companies purely public cloud these types applications based sensitive personal data financial health data require private premise deployment its technology government regulations
in regard this is long term vision  reasons scaled inference went investors sercinoglu says vinod khosla long term investor longest term thinkers in business long term vision ai machine learning really resonated him
longer term says seek offer powerful technology public cloud api virtually application personalized magazines intelligent context sensitive address books app launchers e commerce sites disruptive data driven startups (uber airbnb rent runway advertising systems search engines on ultimately goal power intelligent popular products services world
