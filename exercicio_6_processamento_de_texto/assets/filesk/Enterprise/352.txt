through partnership dedrone integrate airbus long range radar technology systems comprised ground based sensors data analytics reporting software cloud
the radar (and data it expands range startup drone detection systems radius  kilometers open spaces according dedrone ceo joerg lamprecht
dedrone standard hardware distributed use sensors set data centers surrounded trees embassies corporate campuses stadiums small drone fly just overhead but indoors near windows attempting capture images hack internal systems
 business owns operates like airport water treatment facility nuclear power plant test tracks new vehicles driven safety tested dedrone hardware long range communication capabilities airbus radar allow centralized set up
lamprecht noted  integrated best available technology market systems surveillance cameras mics frequency scanners power airbus radar which will allow reach new industries
dedrone focuses drone detection monitoring counter measures bring unmanned aerial vehicles block entering particular space
opening systems integrating new hardware data sources like airbus allows dedrone work increasingly conjunction physical aerial security systems example jamming units force drone land crashing critical infrastructure
