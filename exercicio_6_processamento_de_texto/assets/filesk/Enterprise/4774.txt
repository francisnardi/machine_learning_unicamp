in game of computing swings roundabouts win lose ditch hoary old desktop for shiny portable tablet to hanker hard plastic keys precise mouse movements trying wrangle work spreadsheets move
well kickstarter project tablet dock reckons there way specifically virtualizing input devices  way of a cloud platform remote desktop integration  tablet user use a mouse keyboard in conjunction slate turning it into a quasi desktop
the sphinx docking station just piece hinged metal contains usb ports plugging peripherals power ethernet (and/or wi fi connectivity it the hardware portal links tablet user maker dockoffice cloud platform which what enables the computing sleight hand lets tablet user work desktop
while hardware point view sphinx look straightforward end user end things  tablet propped up on dock which has keyboard mouse plugged in (other peripherals apparently  supported future  doing lot data shuffling background turn tablet quasi desktop
the tablet connects remote desktop (on you’ve installed dockoffice software sphinx dock hooks dockoffice virtual device hub remote desktop linked specific sphinx user using (via code input sends virtualised mouse keyboard data hub  turn relays remote desktop screen output sent tablet user peripheral inputs are made manifest slate
yes effort just tablet user mash plastic keys
the unique thing doing connecting mouse keyboard (and additional devices future directly remote computer (through cloud direct interconnection tablet mouse keyboard says dockoffice cto leendert van der plas solution works with ipad options connect mouse (ios does support mouse
all existing docking stations tablets power devices (mostly keyboards  used tablets using type direct connection (bluetooth mostly adds the sphinx is mainly developed use remote computing solutions  pc  business environment windows terminal vdi or daas environment
most existing remote desktop apps work conjunction sphinx according to van der plas including splashtop teamviewer logmein pocketcloud microsoft remote desktop real vnc van der plas claims noticeable latency input device virtualization  saying lag comparable devices directly connected tablet laptop
remote desktops computers  used conjunction wake lan machine using power sphinx workhorse does need  /   just gets fired demand
there scope sphinx utility spread tablet app developers interested potential end offering sdk
if application developer wants integrate devices directly app use our sdk our sdk developers build native application html application use devices connected the sphinx example  drawing application ipad using wacom pen tablet says van der plas
in terms competitors netherlands based dockoffice reckons new company doing device connection cloud people product competition laptops says
competing laptop  case customer tablet need laptop basic work remote environment situation (something lot medical educational market solution replace extra laptop/pc
inside sphinx  powered new raspberry pi compute modules announced earlier month  or  assuming hits funding goal  makes market (at time writing they’ve raised just   days left run
the reason use pi module the sphinx can  used developments (it open platform people build in sphinx pi setup tablet (ipad  used screen pi module setup standard remote desktop apps  used screen pi tablet van der plas adds
the dock starts  kickstarter backers  price includes years free subscription dockoffice platform (which required peripheral virtualization function  just slightly odd looking tablet stand
once the free subscription period lapses dockoffice cost  year (final pricing tbc
