for years we’ve hearing follow the data truth set businesses free and sports teams  chief proponents data driven decision making oakland athletics general manager billy beane famously conceived of the idea described book movie moneyball
what beane did process driven gut experience eye balling tried apply analytics order instead drafting guy based looks looked specifically data just data  special kind analytics developed james (who way works boston red sox
in  john henry bought boston red sox wealthy man money making data driven investment decisions decided apply principles baseball te worked time better did beane fact red sox won world series    beane teams pretty time  won championship (the red sox actually hired beane in  changed mind returned oakland
that does mean data driven decision making wrong  game winning beane doing right brings year boston red sox biggest group underachievers likely grace baseball diamond
dating  te   finished   appears  bit anomaly won  games  went win world series
last year abysmal season te series offseason moves including adding new starting pitchers and giving big fat contracts to pablo sandoval hanley ramirez to add pop lineup amazingly guys te traded signed performed expected (ramirez great april plate  cooled considerably fielding just awful tried convert shortstop outfielder
the red sox bet good hitting pitchers induced lot ground balls good defense win fair share games unfortunately that thesis failed materialize far hitting bad pitching inconsistent best defense poor
how bad according espn red sox rank th american league runs scored runs allowed earned run average (or average number runs pitching staff gives innings and tied th errors pretty poor consider  teams league
as today the red sox record of   lost games row appear  te spiraling control headed place finish al east
what does enterprise hearing years big data going  big thing enterprise decision makers instead going guts case years years  mit professor andrew mcafee likes hippo syndrome (highest paid person opinion wins  told just look data magically transform businesses gives real answers
i consistently heard theme heard people ridicule expertise quaint notion experts really data follow data answers
well red sox following data years ( notwithstanding evidence great data lick good looked statistically year te failed play ability eventually i waiting happen  i ca help  feel idea winning attitude red sox clearly right now
may data human element having judgement nuance emotion understanding data human making decision humans involved (and add pressure playing crucible boston sports does  work planned
sure follow data  i believe   remember end like  boston red sox probably want organization be
