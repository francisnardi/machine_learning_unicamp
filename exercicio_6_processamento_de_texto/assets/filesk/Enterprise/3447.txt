amazon web services announced new service today called lambda stateless event driven compute service dynamic applications does require provisioning compute infrastructure
as aws cto werner vogels pointed enable programmers reduce overall development effort simply write code define event triggers run automatically conditions met automation save time money instead running stack run infrequently run resources runs automatically

it worth noting hacker news discussion of the new service programmer early access service indicated does time speed service  potential transforming way programmers use aws
lambda care managing scaling monitoring milliseconds event triggered processed stateless cloud functions thousands of these events run parallel (and limited way resources
as vogels pointed lamda designed follow basic programming principles function (business logic data (business states interactions driven events interact business logic data operates lambda operates basic programming principles

for service support java script/node  vogels suggested  additional language support road create function need context resources associated resource changes triggers function automatically runs just expect intervention
there free tier try offering  million free requests month  million seconds compute time month ( depends memory using pay tiers somewhat complicated charging compute time units  milliseconds pay request
