facebook debuted chatbots messenger week fanfare promising consumers new way interact favorite businesses company popular messaging service idea messenger users simply chat automated software programs things like read latest news cnn a weather report shopping practice bots  launch  failed live hype
trying use bots simple tasks  like finding rain buying black shirt  frustrating disappointing ultimately far efficient simply visiting company website itself
that downplay potential bots long term possibilities provided bringing facebook large base businesses messenger could better serve customers increasingly use mobile messaging apps smartphones
however chatbots messenger platform launches bot experience leaves  desired
to good feel facebook chatbots demoed featured bots facebook promoting messenger platform website cnn shopping app spring weather app poncho
each bot try link provided which opens directly messenger chat interface business

for starters clicking link  new short urls aimed facebook page owners (in mme format  merely launched chat window there greeting text business question words know bot interact know begin
does require trigger word phrase just say hi
facebook reportedly soon address problem finalizes rollout messenger greetings allow businesses pass note customers kick chat session greetings instruct users started using bot it unclear facebook enabled chatbots launch concept new to so many of today mobile messaging users old remember chatting im bots like smarterchild pc days
as turns bots operate way
for example simply saying hi cnn poncho generated automated response  spring bot ignored (i google way talk spring say shopping it
unfortunately problems using bots
here simple problem chatbot help solve i thought i’m market new shirt i like color black i want spend lot spring new shopping bot help point nice items
i did expect succeed helping narrow shirts details like sleeve length fabric type early point  i believed pull possibilities
i wrong
after getting shopping session started keyword trigger spring bot interface easy use asks series questions narrow looking  men women items clothing shoes accessories  click response
after i narrowed tops  spring returned items thought i like
why i like particular items i know spring knows shopping history style shirt i’m looking color occasion (work casual else
it returned white shirts t shirt sweater
uh ok
at point i’d like ask bot options  that
i tried chatting bot assuming point i said trigger new help message explains continue using service
i like i told met silence
hi i spoke void happened
can more

finally bot answered informing i return options click start process hopeful items returned randomized group i’d new shirts i repeated things i did just that
the bot returned five shirts
well i need  specific i thought
please black shirts i said
the bot gave link website
i know thinking spring did black shirts   did! link pointed women black shirts spring site choose
the thing just easier visit spring website directly dancing chatty interface

poncho snarky weather bot worse i got talking simple hi weather reports failed deliver basic information like rain
after getting location asking message daily weather reports (nope! i said told i chat information specifically
feel free ask going rain need sunglasses jacket just say hello time time!
so i asked going rain
poncho answered wet warm yuck
i’m sorry  what…
is supposed  real answer
i tried poncho clarify  did wet mean rain coming then
sorry going to say cat meow said
you’ve got  kidding me
when rain i asked did understand
what time rain i tried go
what percentage chance rain i attempted awkwardly
wet warm yuck bot repeated
i threw phone room
no thanks
of featured bots cnn did better  issues responded hi thankfully i clue supposed say things
it directs pick news want hear stories stories ask cnn
top stories curated selection news offer summary link cnn site read summary feature bit reminiscent quartz standalone news messaging app good way briefed important aspects day news

ask cnn lets specify topic you’d like read stories returns suggestions based you’ve reading (presumably improve time
while cnn bot performed tasks fairly failed areas example programmed look topics keyword apparently did grasp nuance query asking news
it plausible think ask news bot order filtered selection day news cnn bot look word headline returning suggestions instead stories bot returned exactly articles
cnn mobster heirs cuba owe  pay cnn money video entitled ken burns trump divides sanders does too
not consider stories second was returned word headline
may i did word correctly

oddly asking just news returned different set (now stories word headline including op ed called easter teaches heaven
similarly requests latest news stumbled  looking keyword headline
this helpful all
while tests brief goes messenger chatbots long way fulfilling potential  useful way interact businesses brands chat
these bots clearly need  able interact with human customers conversationally better understanding people actually saying need functionality  like ability pull specific items shopping  need  better programmed start
some bots better course
the guardian gave different chatbots dry run had similarly mixed results simple bots like wsj cnn news bots did better operator shopping bot  claims respond to emoji queries  did really work sequel stories choose adventure style story bot fun report found
the question facebook business users worth time effort build bots chatbot phase end fad
for entirely unproven customers want chat with bots  especially work poorly experience improved short order  mobile equivalent punching way business automated customer service hotline
at end day people want chat person machine when trying customer service
they may think using company website native app easier faster trying bot respond properly they simply ignore bots
and people try bots fail useful right gate good chance businesses wo second chance to win customers in future
sigh i wrote spring chatbot ending experience today
the bot said got note  shortly (spring says bots partly human powered message sent staff i wondered
over hour later spring asked i wanted shopping
not bot i think
