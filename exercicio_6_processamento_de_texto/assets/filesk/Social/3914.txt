almost year ago google released diversity data kicking wide ranging industry conversation tech companies venture capital firms unrepresentative racial gender make rest us
dozens companies followed google suit while issue gender the venture world front burner the ellen pao kleiner perkins verdict friday
 mitch freada kapor along mitch founded lotus development corporation sold ibm for  billion  freada phd has been active issue diversity years run a venture firm kapor capital math science educational programs students color process building new center downtown oakland around ideas
they shared lessons work interview i did weeks ago
what say changed diversity conversation started doing kind work
freada better talking issue prior google releasing numbers nearly impossible major tech company attention nearly impossible major sand hill road vc firm attention kleiner perkins sitting court
the numbers gone terms white women computer science  numbers  low underrepresented people color
i’m hoping we did new framework i mean gloss i mean deeper nuanced sophisticated understanding
not pipeline problem 
actually i working story month ago east palo alto i remember woman runs regarded non profit telling pipeline problem investment problem struck partly idea pipeline problem repeated over feels like way abdicating responsibility saying education fault really individual or company it
freada substance pipeline problem issue  i talk lot leaky pipeline problem takes forms  layer bias involved
you look drop points gets  freshman computer science student look big school district level data you’ve failed rd grade math hit certain absentee level freshman year predict certainty student going drop high school
so doing rd grade math level failing course correct write kid grade just heart breaking like points ought  rallying intervening flipping argument head
 pipeline problem i think understanding bias operates
what kinds advice growth stage tech companies thinking diversityfreada piece advice stop thinking meritocracy
because believe meritocracy numbers like everybody released data implicit message caucasian men better  overrepresented endorsing notion people good ton them
mitch remarkable fact people consistent time moment person acknowledge like diverse mix employees moment believe genuine meritocracy best people ideas funded extent like silicon valley meritocratic nature completely wrong just wrong comes matters race class
freada right mit wharton harvard business school study took business plan won business plan competition knew investable
then ran controlled experiment business plan videos narrated male female voices pitch narrated male voice judges chose  percent time
i’ve doing lot customized talks hidden bias help companies understand  despite best intentions   making biased decisions anyways
i try come kinds practical steps mitigate bias end talk things simple removing names resumes
or rooney rule national football league adopted decade ago requires teams interview minority candidates head coaching senior football operations jobs requirement hire candidates just include interview process
or changing employee referral networks i ask companies employee referral networks say yes  i ask they’d structure referrals underrepresented groups people think discriminatory unfair
they think having employee referral company skewed numbers unfair think getting diversity way unfair
yeah i understand profile tristan walker year fast company journalist pointed recruiting friends just happen  white male people naturally gravitate people who like  structurally racist even deliberate malicious intent exclude people
freada things i think does work know earlier decades work things sounds like feel like affirmative action variety reasons seen unfair happens candidates brought mechanisms face kinds career limiting backlash
if look law firm world i remember early s african american associate i interviewed tier law firm told affirmative action worst thing happened careers automatic assumption really belong really qualified  affirmative action i worry seeing reactions today
mitch lot lazy interviewing tech companies like jelly beans does  they quite biased google started disavow them
freada likes talk idea distance traveled did candidate start hurdles overcome
how think term culture fit rationalization including excluding people
freada i think lot confusion need nice important look dynamics culture fit early
one favorite quotes twilio jeff lawson way diversity groups led women engineers engineering deeply involved company diversity inclusion efforts critically important getting right having  annoying thing
 jeff said like ‘when  good time think diversity i’ve got  white male engineers
it brilliant poignancy business fires think diversity building great company going prioritize it
to understand culture ask succeeds begin  inherently biased basis gender race
who think role model frontfreada figured point terms demographic balance  talk companies making real efforts twilio doing way completely consistent values org side
it baked company opposed afterthought developer conference signal reached figure diverse audience panel it intersects parts business
what programs think actually effective lots programs google started fund like code lots regional locally focused organizations ones actually good
freada couple things i’m trained researcher i believe rigorous evaluation groups ought  looking outcomes second thing building map leaky pipeline we’ve got bit herd mentality way money going hackathons teaching privileged girls code tie else
i understand appeal hackathons  got  connected  especially dealing kids going  families to college you’ve got responsibility help different points pipeline too
then i think organizations like code i think foundation world subsidizing companies biggest market caps planet placing philanthropic dollars training underrepresented kids  placed facebook google twitter public companies multi billion dollars market caps
mitch course startup hiring you’ll want hire people google facebook twitter having credentials really important
 freada speaking training programs cohort  inclusive view host institution google facebook  matching philanthropic contributions going making investment developing parts pipeline lot money coming philanthropic sources
you run progr smash students color math science did learn that
freada thought demonstration progr ton talent created opportunity kids come point smash
we stage room lot approaches  want talk with a lot intentioned people starting programs plug holes way mapping drop points opposed th person funds girls coding progr dollars
and think equally important expose tech workers kids kids  exposed math science
when engineers come volunteer smash hackathons reaction blown away smart excited kids are
and think did really think black brown boys girls  excited hackathon
what end pipeline venture sidefreada trying kapor capital invest communities well
mitch loves talk entrepreneurs building things scratch itch talk entrepreneurs like frederick hutson ana roca castro built businesses
mitch locked john doerr gurley vinod khosla room year thought  pigeonly hutson startup roca castro plaza familia lived experience does include federal prison
 rate businesses terms impact terms going  able financially folks table ideas going created beneficiaries services going  helped jobs going  created investors going earn return
are going share returns prove it
mitch takes seven  years prove venture strategy year i expect better worse
we running entire portfolio intent fully reveal internal performance money run external limited partners i mind making year forward looking commitment this
how think strategy terms confrontational versus flexible getting industry change (it classic tension activism
freada i think room outsiders  demanding shaming important role
mitch  change happen levels look y combinator look regime change paul grah s altman changing guard significantly greater commitment diversity reflected cohorts non profits blogging actively this
y combinator like harvard stanford accelerator programs stayed wanted  not
look jessica livingston look speaking wo making speeches like years ago
the thing remember time scale change happens silicon valley used accelerated moore law timeline we’ve seen times
 look instance civil rights struggle selma culmination half century work naacp founded  took half century to selma mid way point talk has changed need think time frame human institutions change
it fine  impatient dilemmas human  case big venture firms probably going change existing general partners retire
freada people change slowly technologies invent
what think groups like rainbow push coalition historical roots civil rights movement went big tech companies shareholder meetings demanded diversity data  released companies actually did it
mitch i’d say necessary  sufficient playbook used wall street decades ago clear wall street engaged lasting change
freada history written tech companies started releasing data year crop companies like hp cisco intel releasing along
their numbers necessarily look better companies had cheap diversity programs past  years worthwhile question ask broken existing approaches diversity
i  optimist i  doing work i young companies people eager learn start employee resources groups focus diversity
 look historic diversity programs regardless industry company were fueled concern sued discrimination positive motivator good business reason
last year effort diversity numbers good thing  coming response external pressure journalists outsiders persistent asking numbers companies doing fix it
 needs come twitter ought  looking using product mirror customer base inside
if look pew internet studies uses products like twitter pinterest facebook companies look like user bases
