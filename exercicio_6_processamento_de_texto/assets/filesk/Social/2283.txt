to paraphrase oft seen internet trollism ‘internet comments worst thing hitler’ by i mean suck suck bad really suck
the problem we have right internet comments clear negativity nastiness burying discouraging else
when online writer relieved comments clocked by your post only spammers touting ways earn  work home and/or posting link video boosting your sales leads  just  weeks!  say random vitriol abject stupidity violent outpourings  know wrong very wrong standard reader feedback structure internet
for pity sake tech world  better way!
and i mean turning comments entirely   websites doing that including media companies (apparently lacking resources and/or willpower effectively police the effluent that inexorably flows half internet
 switching comments entirely to surrender trolls bile colored flag
and  pleasing hear silence half hearted troll dirge means you silencing genuinely engaged readers  probably had interesting say felt worth say are giving chance to grow community own
and sure media company offload comments to social networks  outsourcing commenting to facebook and twitter content probably being recirculated   web users attention gated social tech platforms  especially dominant platforms formulate controlling media/content distribution strategies  arguably very short term thinking
on shifting sands online publishing really  fresh impetus for media firms facing commoditization social web attacks ad powered business models retain sustain strong brand identity doing absolutely requires having an engaged community people engaged with stuff let voices  heard proposition you offer
and embattled comment arena steps civil a startup founded online comment moderator aja bogdanoff got tired trying firefight endless stre comments spewing unregulated pipe answer a comment plug in that requires users engage with a framework civility quality specific entry criteria for able air views
she argues current model digital services using human moderators assess comment content acceptability  typically fact  is not efficient way result result clear… welcome trolltown population idiot who shouts loudest
so determine civility quality ask readers  judge that ergo you crowdsource comment moderation civil case means review three comments post one
the asks comment posters review quality civility comment gets submitted review (and potential posting  effectively reminds sanity check opinions

do extra steps result fewer overall comments posted te claims seeing marginal impact far  claiming a cent abandonment rate testing
users also accrue civility rating based behavior within the commenting platform is used control commenting permissions certain flash point scenarios (see civil ‘sieve mode’ feature instance
it really simple idea technically speaking  simple wonder it has  question just leads interesting thought bad internet comments actually the byproduct neglect a direct consequence thoughtless design zero/minimal investment much like weeds growing untended plot  create conditions good stuff grow really  expect
we question lot says bogdanoff i ask obvious question  lot tech companies right really consider content responsibility provide the tools let site owners post comments  people actually publish say moderate site owner responsibility to expensive moderation teams obviously ca up
i think lot tech shape people interact online adds i lot theories companies   i know sure
in civil case algorithmic special sauce going background  determine readers asked rate comments quite simple appears surface select comments popularity contest how bogdanoff explains it
she wo  drawn exactly algorithms work  given comment platform needs guard risk trolls trying game mechanisms en masse (eg like the co ordinated comment attacks around #gamergate  say it involves looking behavior person
we’ve lot thought making popularity contest that easy bring bunch buddies change vote adds time pattern person behavior able determine acting trustworthy manner
in nutshell civil thesis consequences social structures real world public spaces help (most people doing saying civil things public time  online lawless story
online social structures systems place constantly remind people indulging baser instincts leads negative consequences… so people doing things  ‘what missing keeps people doing things argues bogdanoff
instead saying ‘gosh people horrible online’ helpful look perspective ‘why people horrible face face situations'
why ask readers to judge comments on both civility quality try encourage people to set aside more emotive personal responses  mean like dislike particular comment  push them to make a impartial assessment based a comment honestly composed vs intended troll acceptable vs abusive
what really need need need change people submitting content submitting comments need make sure giving good reasons behave need make sure equipped know content comment she adds
civil comments requires users register comment  does enforce real names policy  unlike example facebook comments te argues allowing users comment using pseudonyms important protection people participating public debate
real policies… harm folks acting good faith preventing bad behavior/bad actors says civil founder designer christa mrgan real really  used i think terrible thing require people way just order participate i think high price ask
so business end this crowdsourced comment moderation pipe does site user comments  quality/civility floating comments minimum bar quality/civility
that tweaking right default ratings comment / approval  actually experimenting different variations lower volume sites make configurable according publisher wants says mrgan
the te started working business january year raised  in angel investment far product (civil comments public testing mock sites they’ve created installed party sites  hopefully soon… talks they say customer front
the initial business model saas  selling bb  plan open freemium product individual bloggers use future pipeline ideas products extend civil comments albeit discussing plans publicly stage
when start looking designing platforms way we’ve a lot things we’d like  able tackle is established says mrgan
is licensing business strikes are ideas that could  applied to social platforms twitter sustained problem ordinated abuse attacks (albeit doing scenes to try prevent spread of abusive tweets
may they’ll say laugh i suggest this
they upbeat timing despite moves websites turn off comments general sense fatigue among web users entire commenting process owing to the effort vs harassment ratio
i think lot sites understand level engaged users  valuable assets communities right communities formed content says bogdanoff
with platforms currently exist lot companies numbers just work  costs money moderate comments high volume like civil comments really helps reset balance puts control hands best community members i think going sites willing jump really does benefit them
it like having mini social network right site adds mrgan
i posit accident startup with a mission fix online commenting led female founders  given hatred women frequently endure in online comments

the pair diplomatic point it definitely problem problem everybody really deserve decent culture online say
how confident building survive ordinated abusive comment onslaught triggered gamergate
i know want record confident ca  gamed… i think goes long way addressing ordinated attacks i think going  perfect  use real world benchmark real world  cent safe ordinated attack right  built systems think going make difference says bogdanoff
one systems a feature called ‘siege mode’ individual article  put into a partial comment lock able accept comments  comment article civility rating high trust level high explains mrgan
if civility rating  brand new commenter fall mode automatically based suspicious activity publisher article siege mode new commenter civility rating just high you’ll little message saying ‘i’m sorry article receiving high suspicious activity comment section restricted people civility rating  cent higher  improve civility rating going leaving civil comments site
it takes work effort raise civility rating adds
a comment platform designed make trolls sweat talking…
