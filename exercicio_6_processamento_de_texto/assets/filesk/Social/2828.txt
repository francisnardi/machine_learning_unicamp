facebook just making your donation lady perpetual exemption a bit easier more visible
today facebook announced it opening donate button available action nonprofits pages linked advertisements
a facebook spokesperson told techcrunch statement
facebook rolled donate button late  specific partners like american cancer society red cross for nonprofit partners button seamlessly integrated pages donation took place internally credit card info  stored site

it appears facebook looks open donate button groups specifically partnered making process little bit cumbersome probably an effort company to further donations given potentially unpopular non profit causes
now click donate now button on non profit page alerted organization endorsed affiliated facebook redirected page external site complete donation

without embedded payment processes button really just action link valuable organizations advertisements i’m sure practice it pretty just adds click process making donation as it berates pop up that facebook does endorse cause unexpectedly whisks away new browser window
this definitely valuable tool for nonprofits  pushing users external sites this move kind flies face recent facebook efforts to make organization facebook page central location user goes to for information a group
