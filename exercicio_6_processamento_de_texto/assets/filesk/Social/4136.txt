well startup called worklife built tools designed make meetings better current batch startups incubated y combinator i got phone week founder ceo dave kashen discuss product
naturally used worklife startups promising make meetings better  struck kashen product simplicity  does require big changes existing behavior   pretty helpful
he told worklife divides usage broad categories  meeting opportunity create edit agenda items meeting join workroom track agenda check items notes assign tasks counter shows time left meeting scheduled end worklife sends meeting summary action items refer old meeting notes future meeting
and yes works mobile too
none like make dramatic difference  kashen suggested simple act having agenda clock really help things track   able feel comfortable cutting windbag room saying excuse  topic
i like idea collaborative note taking meeting i’ve definitely stuck email threads people debate actually happened person took notes worklife disagreement confusion  obvious leave room hopefully  worked right away
and hey good notes kashen said meetings  black box way feel comfortable skipping meeting (assuming need  involved actual decision making know you’ll brought speed afterwards
the current service free  worklife plans charge premium features future
