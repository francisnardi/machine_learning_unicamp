a couple recent stories got really intrigued tells techcrunch secret yo recently meerkat/periscope i thought level momentum traction generated apps time ‘unbelievable’ look phenomena start amplified small group people making huge difference i wanted try understand inner workings
it fair say livestreaming app meerkat inflated over a hot sxsw week in austin quickly deflating twitter owned periscope blew place politics week be a long time tech
to better understand hype bubbles/cycles camillieri experiment analyses angel list activity and twitter timelines chosen tech targets gathering any mentions are answering tweets favorite  or any signal pointing person puts it
if person replies person b favorites b tweets mentions b i  assuming ‘pays attention’ b saying b belongs ‘inbound’ map influence in example listens b belongs b ‘outbound map influence explains
the tool shows interaction visualizations person network  clicking individual photo toggles an inbound outbound map displaying speaking listening the premise help entrepreneurs unearth connected angels/vcs tech sphere

he concedes tool is currently skewed based/silicon valley investors loses relevancy when comes to mapping wider geographical influence networks european tech scene visually appealing way to satisfy curiosity valley power circles is digitally hobnobbing with who
camillieri who when hacking mind maps is also working pocket concierge startup called timista reckons potential turning game angels into something more powerful to help facilitate communication between entrepreneurs investors i got feedback interesting ideas i  going allocate time project says from i gathered current version helped people discover important angels
what experiment perhaps powerfully conveys digital communications that in context feel quasi private  @reply  directly on twitter  are absolutely data is ripe for harvesting combining repackaging presenting a new context one above foregrounds quasi private communications and connections making online relationships far explicit still everyone these concentric tech influence circles knew already
