in accelerating social media feedback loops modern internet age ‘do feed trolls phrase appears fallen fashion favor collective memory
the result impoverished quality debate frequently increasingly appears  approaching resembling mass hysteria trolls delivered dining demand
simply ca meaningful discussion forever polarizing sides simply screaming apparently convinced threat sending death worldview rules supreme
case point just week twitter finally fell trap internet self aggrandizing troll  self styled supervillain milo yiannopoulos  kicking platform
twitter previously punished yiannopoulos provocations removing privileged blue tick status gone hog ‘no platformed’ platform loving self promoter predictable result yiannopoulos gets step native swagger parading status ‘victim internet censorship’
quoth he
the straw broke jack dorsey quavering resolve let professional troll tweets flow sophisticated ability marshal twitter followers (aka ‘adoring fans forth stre targeted abuse behalf
not yiannopoulos takes responsibility actions followers course walks provocateur fine line  ensuring abuse personally doles horrible remains just person unpleasant viewpoint admit crass getting dirty work
the wider point tech platforms  especially twitter broadcast network   trivially manipulated magnify particular sentiment humorous trending hashtag vile racial abuse
social media platforms structured disseminate information  little bit choreographed intent relatively small set networked connections  chained hugely theatrical effect  repurposing mainstre outlets single cause megaphones
all modern day internet ‘supervillain’ (or social justice warrior/sjw prefer pout action disseminate sympathetic fellow forums watch adoring fans pile merely need sit high backed computer desk chair let devilish laugh
and latest instance yiannopoulos slickly executed social media manipulations public critique ghostbusters actor leslie jones yields vile stre targeted abuse  understandable reaction jones quit twitter
i leave twitter tonight tears sad heart tweeted departing platform cause i did movie hate movie  shit i got today… wrong
what trolls crave attention feed outrage generated provocation accelerate trolls outrage cycles doing hoping you’ll  firstly paying attention reacting way paint unjust (eg shutting celebrate win (eg shutting target
in leslie jones case yiannopoulos chalk wins censorship twitter self censorship jones quitting twitter criticized performance fans piled racially abuse her
this ‘by book’ formula lurks trodden maxim ‘do feed trolls
yet twitter just fed internet self styled king troll course meal finest troll dining
platforms power perspective
so learn sorry situation apart obvious  trolls horrible racial abuse intolerable
one clear takeaway structures social networks far trivially subverted manipulated entities malicious determined intent twitter clearly far stop orchestrated pile ins designed amplify abuse carry campaigns harassment platform
bottom line free speech choreographed campaign targeted abuse
as i’ve pointed time #gamergate saga …small orchestrated online groups magnify impact influence fringe viewpoints weaponizing mainstre digital services to repurpose platforms propaganda machines new thing  frequency it is happening online appears be growing toxicity generated harder escape tactics play are honed polished greater effect
 arguably  need consider
we say certain malicious entities holding (black mirror political correctness abhor  aka modus operandi sjw foes  using single issue megaphone method aka bounce amplification possible follower based tech platforms win (or argue yiannopoulos internet ‘culture wars
at strange juncture evolution mainstre media donald trump achieving similar effect subverting news media drama seeking lens
the point debate gets closed nuance gets tramped underfoot empathy gets battered death lose
that ugly truth yiannopoulos illustrating sort ‘media process deconstructing performance art’ i way
point single opinion amplified megaphone method follower armies intent on crushing alternative perspectives  oppressive differing view
moreover self styles ‘internet supervillain’  taken face value person stating playing role inviting critique melodrama mission is force enemies confront manichean flaws reflected reverse
to deconstruct drama walk right massive pitfall trolls exist to set self styled king troll gloating twitter whale tangled subtle net
zooming increasingly clear shouting points view internet happens sides political spectrum  leftwing campaigners taking diversity/feminist/gay rights/etc cause urging followers (implicitly intentionally shout opposing viewpoints conservative supervillains jerking liberal chains rattling leftwing cages mainstre tech platforms acting manist white supremacist tantrum pantomime plain sight
you argue radical left radical right appears willing accept  shades grey allowed one particular entrenched perspective  fight prisoners culture wars tech platforms power turn personal viewpoint into a weapon mass media destruction aiming to level landscape debate via tribalism fervent follower armies
yet internet connecting diverse viewpoints more people come online going to used confronting alternative views simply screaming difference does  approach scale
you like message  trigger finger shooting messenger perpetuating internet culture clashes encouraging ramping verbal violence reduction diversity debate available tech platforms  fast only mass media (and noted pile in public shamings that close debate cementing majority judgment are fast new majority entertainment
if actions end stripping possibility nuance individual disagreement demanding complicated humans reduce polarized positions ca  surprised braindead abuse left impoverished twitter knee jerk banning of single transgressing individuals fails address underlying problem hijacking platform orchestrated abuse campaigns
as tempting  censoring individual trolls technology industry wins war trolling individual stupid opinions just one voice sea voices tech platforms need to tackle those actors weaponize personal viewpoint cutting strings the puppet armies disproportionate volume force views others
it single bad provocative opinion trouble society technology platforms fear engage difference publicly shun ignorance closing single voice hand entity verified status persecuted individual gift them additional fuel pour fires live to start
rather need away power turn opinion mass attack follower armies wreak havoc mainstre platforms twitter should  seeking close down with tools prevent pile ins orchestrated abuse rules structures designed to pop promote filter bubbles
social discourse suffers ca support understanding alternative views empathy rarely encouraged closing door lone problem voice
at the end day offer courtesy listening how can properly articulate valid reasons disagree
