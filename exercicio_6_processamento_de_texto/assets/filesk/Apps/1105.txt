back december mozilla called day with failed firefox os mobile business said pivot technology new internet things strategy amid good dose skepticism platform (and organization failed area succeed arguably complex mozilla laid projects in iot shortlist ready intelligent personal user agent smart home initiative crowdsourced network based sensors voice interface iot devices
mozilla says looking community members help develop test areas
project link is described mozilla personal user agent understands preferences want interact world devices home automate connected world you
originally project called foxlink looks like the idea for link to learn preferences  able control connected devices getting involved  controlled kind intelligence mozilla  going here reminds little personal assistant samantha envisioned film mozilla says project early stage
the aim of project sensor web create network sensors supply crowdsourced data be accessible proprietary i’d argue open web riposte services like ibm watson bringing mountain public private data  proprietary umbrella given ibm acquisition weather company coincidence pilot project for sensor web  a crowdsourced pm air pollution sensor network mozilla visualizes sensor web work

project smart home is mozilla middle ground answer apple homekit diy solutions like raspberry pi essentially platform mozilla proposes offer hardware software makers run connected home devices worth potentially commercial mandate sensor web project little hesitation too
people want affordable easy use smart home technology  life everyday problems ca  solved using box systems people solve problems diy solutions like raspberry pi  solutions far complicated people mozilla writes clear market gap…  know consumers really want need gap
mozilla says phases project smart home  research missing today smart home including limitations existing solutions
the fourth final project called vaani link intelligence samantha vaani wants  voice essentially echo list voice interface developers add apps piece hardware users interact naturally efforts mozilla says  interactions home temperature house turn lights upstairs linking respectively smart thermostat lighting  kinds commands/queries included
again i know lot skeptics potential firefox os given track record far believe mozilla  focussing developers clearly strongest area web browser i agree definitely   happy group trying mileage  left firefox os giving good
iot nascent taking open web approach developing contrast lot proprietary work going bad thing
