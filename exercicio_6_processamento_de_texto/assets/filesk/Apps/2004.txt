better sprint outside uber ditch you just minutes late ride start charging you car previously people got minute grace period to car arrived cancel trip sent request  uber telling users request ready face fees tacked ride according screenshot sree sreenivasan
uber tells running pilot progr new policy nyc new jersey phoenix dallas  evaluating results weeks deciding expand markets pilot just paused bug   running soon
update uber says users  hit fee  minutes driver arriving   minutes waiting rider start  charged minute rate city  added ride cost drivers incur formal penalty ditching passengers time car
the problem ubers actually waiting key advantages taxis needed use bathroom grab forgot lived floor building lots stairs slow elevator uber private cars  politely parked you
 minutes wait time practically  standing door outside make sure miss ride especially troubling uber etas vary  accurate cars marked having arrived block away
you expect car minutes arrive  shows dinged fees expect arrive minutes takes traffic lights way streets delays you’ll end standing street does feel like comfortable experience uber  known
senior citizens mobility impaired parents trying wrangle kids  lot likely left charged driver leaves them they’d wait uber car service send new driver make late destination
as change cancellation policy reasonable minutes plenty time realize wrong address need car cheaper faster ride service minute cancellation window likely hurt drivers waste time gas beginning drive getting cancelled with compensation
 driver cancellation policy feels rude unforgiving sure people  requesting cars close ready leave forcing drivers burn tons time waiting minutes long  getting ditched does appropriate  two minutes feels short start charging people
uber perspective makes experience better riders
the company tells me drivers time valuable expect riders request ride ready know waiting rider pickup location  frustrating select cities running small pilot drivers compensated time riders running bit late change plans riders drivers respectful time runs smoothly uber experience improves everyone
perhaps change trickle quicker etas passengers drivers wait  really just improves uber relationship drivers fight straying competitors tiny extra cash granted driver waiting extra minutes incentivize patience wait you

uber built  reliable despite hate gets surge pricing designed preserve discouraging demand ensure supply emergency absolutely make flight meeting trust  cars available willing pay surge
yet worry going ditched unforeseen delay uber reliability destroyed
