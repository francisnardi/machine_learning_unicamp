an app made by deepmind google owned ai company working collaboration nhs royal free trust london used help identify hospital patients who  risk acute kidney disease (aki currently use techcrunch learned
the collaboration tech giant portion of uk publicly funded health service drawn criticism breadth of patient data used power app targets single medical condition
deepmind royal free criticized approaching the uk medicines healthcare devices regulator mhra prior using streams app hospitals mhra responsible for standards safety quality efficacy healthcare products include software apps
it emerged deepmind royal free trust are discussions mhra over streams app needs  registered as medical device
we contact google  currently discussions app needs  registered device spokesman mhra told techcrunch
the spokesman said the project currently formal investigation mhra
we talking  required doing i investigation added just various technicalities apps necessarily clear cut say medicine just trying  clear doing constituted app
deepmind announced the collaboration develop app with royal free nhs trust february mhra informed plans point deepmind royal free assert requirement gain prior approval develop pilot app say conducted clinical trials/investigations
a royal free spokesman says they carried small user tests app
we’ve asked mhra point pilot product would  considered constitute clinical trial investigation view update post response
the mhra normal procedures mean issue letter ‘no objection’ reviewing application to run clinical investigation medical device  assuming does concerns proposal streams app has not gone review process
asked normal procedure product makers approach regulator prior starting trial mhra spokesman said with regulation discussion helps process that  case anything
separately uk data protection watchdog ico confirmed techcrunch it received a small number complaints streams app currently looking it
we aware story making enquiries organisation processing using people sensitive personal information accordance data protection act said spokeswoman
direct patient care vs secondary use 
another criticism streams app project centered patient data is being processed at time project launch clear how data being passed google owned company streams app project
however earlier month new scientist obtained copy data sharing agreement deepmind royal free  which revealed getting access data patients directly affected aki agreement fact shared all hospital admissions data extending years the catchment area london hospitals covers  million people
deepmind asserts access patient data hospitals necessary app predictive function work claims it engaged research says the streams app used direct patient care  important distinction additional regulatory ethical approvals likely  necessary google owned company performing research data set applying machine learning algorithms data says ( deepmind founder mustafa suleyman suggested that might like future
that said clear at point vast majority royal free patients whose data passed deepmind via this collaboration have aki it this secondary usage scenario of data sharing agreement drawn specific criticism patient data privacy groups  given data question personally identifiable  normally nhs regulations  shared parties implied consent  used direct patient care person data shared directly benefit from the sharing
with the streams app  case that for example patient lives outside trust catchment area yet who was rushed to hospital a&e departments accident ends having their data shared google owned company yet will  direct patient care relationship doctors using app
direct care clinician patient case patient blood test clinician reviews results concern deepmind ability access data needed clinical review direct care  individual patient basis bulk says s smith patient privacy group medconfidential
what happened got sus secondary use service data hospital years plus monthly updates including data patients blood test return hospital direct care relationship patients data used google  i’ve asking google question fortnight ca answer one
additionally separately google refer development work definition direct care entirely fine google wanted use live data train decision tree processes  process direct care secondary use adds development work direct care
they  able information data displayed app  long kept used need  written denying need suggests piece paper does exist
again deepmind royal free criticisms claiming all the data is used direct patient care  additional consent regulatory/ethical approvals required app  used
we believe complied relevant policies regulations relating collection processing patient data spokesman royal free said statement throughout nhs patient data routinely collected processed companies purpose direct patient care principle implied consent agreement deepmind standard party data sharing agreement trust data controller deepmind data processor
a deepmind spokesperson added a statement we working clinicians royal free understand technology best help clinicians recognise patient deterioration  case acute kidney injury (aki  hold highest possible standards patient data protection section  assent required case identifiable data agreement  used assist clinicians direct patient care  used research partners royal free touch mhra regarding development work
three user tests
so meant by development work royal free spokesman told techcrunch total small user tests streams run far lasting days maximum clinicians using app test
the spokesman declined specify patients involved tests   given that all three hospitals patients data fed into the algorithm powering app then theory current past patients (extending years hospitals sense ‘involved’ tests data used app likelihood vast majority of these people be unaware their data used purpose
it clear criteria deepmind/the royal free using to evaluate user tests streams app outside body   reviewing tests
the royal free spokesman declined answer specific questions pointing online q&a that published day the mhra contacted google to discuss app
in q&a trust asserts range patient data  analysed order provide diagnostic support track patient outcomes  explanation data person who currently patient used streams app
all data shared purpose improving patient safety care adds historical data used analyse trends detect historical tests diagnoses affect patient care
another interesting question exactly role deepmind project design app partially outsourced (described ‘co designed by’ london based app design studio ustwo algorithm used process patients data told developed the nhs company famed artificial intelligence algorithms engaged act as effectively project manager for a healthcare app
in q&a the royal free says approached deepmind aim developing app improves detection acute kidney injury (aki immediately reviewing blood test results signs deterioration sending alert results appropriate clinician dedicated handheld device
it does provide details specifically chose work google owned company
aki affects patients lead prolonged hospital stays admission critical care units cases death the streams app improves detection aki immediately reviewing blood test results signs deterioration sending alert results appropriate clinician adds
asked personal views data sharing agreement trust deepmind royal free caldicott guardian responsible patient confidentiality enabling appropriate information sharing said is unable comment given approval trust communications department added looked extensively   further details that scrutiny forthcoming
the royal free spokesman confirmed the data sharing agreement trust deepmind signed behalf trust data protection officer subir mondal
