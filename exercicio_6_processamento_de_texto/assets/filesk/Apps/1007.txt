let start talking live streaming feature cameras come unlocked support for g fdd lte g wcdma cell signals  come preinstalled t mobile sim card (which i really easy set t mobile doing deal gb free data company says equals  hours streaming
one interesting feature takes advantage data connection  camera act cellular hotspot tether laptop
anyways streaming
the device lets stre live youtu periscope or custom cloud platform cloud platform accessible mobile app web automatically saves streams going live youtu periscope popular streaming platforms i actually content just using sioeye platform mainly easiest set up
so let talk live streaming quality company says software controlled p @fps p x p data stre kbps p x p kbps
the camera simultaneously record p save memory card streaming lesser quality video
when i tested streaming i definitely noted delay  probably i  had trouble finding  bars t mobile service said stre necessarily choppy just delayed overall camera probably best choice live stre like protest event  phone better cell service streaming quality
 want stre surfing  phone just make camera great alternative data connection little spotty camera waterproof case optional external antenna i improved t mobile service bars i outside testing it
let talk traditional video recording like action cameras camera built time lapse video capture photo capture mp slow motion expensive camera record in
the cheaper model  able p down
i video quality  pretty good definitely good comparable resolutions iphone pretty good action camera typically lower video quality wide angle lenses durable cases going win oscar footage  video quality definitely stands to most action camera market company youtu page bunch recorded footage better sense camera wild

most time i used camera plastic case makes waterproof shock proof i mentioned it also includes external plastic antenna boosts cell signal i really helped improve t mobile service quality
the software little straightforward camera actually runs build android camera platform just app build does boot directly app (and non techies know built android annoying accidentally press wrong button  taken device main menu  gadget nerds like me that like customize explore devices good feature all
that said camera app really built i mentioned earlier hardware startups really hard time building software buggy   sioeye came built solid interface app
overall sioeye really best thing an iphone probably better live streaming event gopro experience action camera world make little better action camera overall  thing sioeye product does includes cellular data connection fills product niche i typically thought  trying action camera live streaming built i’d hard justify buying data connection use occasionally awesome  able stre live beach mountain really impractical schlep phone
