swiss dating app startup blinq is playing with a little algorithmic hot catnip plan add machine learning powered attractiveness assessment feature to help users pick photos best
in launched feature standalone website called howhotio to test appetite robotically judged hotness (the website launched week inevitably days racked up more than two million unique visits hard to see ploughing click festy furrow…
we going integrate algorithm blinq app founder jan berchtold tells techcrunch users possibility upload images set account doing test probably perform better
the tech powering algorithm developed year phd student rasmus rothe of the computer vision lab eth zurich including using image data attractiveness ratings supplied bling  latter gleaned the binary ‘hi bye’ choices blinq users make swipe potential matches
we used  images  million ratings users data base says berchtold explaining role the app data played in the algorithm aesthetic training
on age front rothe says it was trained on images imdb wikipedia  smaller datasets we won age estimation challenge international conference computer vision  chile (the paper against  teams method notes
of course guessing age hard problem humans visual expression age hardly  described as an exact science algorithm guesses range pretty widely/wildly case a decade despite sample photos being taken but a few years apart… yeah age is a hard problem photos lie  lot
the average error algorithm   years says rothe humans   years age range (usually better guessing age people similar age you…  slightly better human prediction problem people high expectations  years lot
this cases estimate age person lot context (ie know person graduated college year ago  +/  year friend group  similar age adds
obviously algorithm lacks context  effectively guessing ‘blind’ explains far worse accuracy level case  hey humans think i’m old too…
on hotness front rothe says te created attractiveness ranking for men women data supplied blinq enable the algorithm learn specific features contribute individual ranked  cent (or  cent  cent gender
the neural network learns parts face look says visualizations showed it tends focus parts face ‘non standard’ beautiful eyes large nose hair sexy beard etc… 
 beauty eye beholder right algorithm meaningfully assess hotness rothe says te initial experiments actually involved trying learn  subjective (he wrote paper  aspect research fed into blinq implementation point  forthcoming photo judging feature app purely be a median measure attractiveness
in paper individual preference prediction tried learn personalized preferences like men beard liked couple men beard proposed recognize know prefer men beard (without telling beard for howhotio we simplified process just learned ‘objective’ criteria… which difficult really subjective thing! adds
blinq currently  monthly active users biggest markets being switzerland germany turkey the uk the us and thailand according to berchtold
as plan offer ai powered hotness recommendations user photos it existing location based tricks sleeve bid to stand crowded  tinder dominated space  feature that shows users the bars clubs city popular singles real time hyperlocal bluetooth beacon powered feature flag up if user current matches bar right (provided bar kitted blinq estimote ibeacons
of course hard envisage blinq mashing forthcoming ai attractiveness smarts existing location based features future point users locations containing the aesthetic singles  judged robotic averages hotspot trending singles bar/club feature  able live name
