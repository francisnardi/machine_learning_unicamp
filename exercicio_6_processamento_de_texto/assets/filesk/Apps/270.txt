google first announced allo duo new messaging video chat apps i/o developer conference earlier year duo launched month ago today allo turn
with allo google combining learned previous messaging products company machine learning smarts allo marks time you’ll  able use google assistant company conversational version google soon way products like google home android wear others

given google owns hangouts messaging service includes video chat obvious question company launch google vp communications products nick fox told reason company wants position hangouts productivity enterprise service allo duo consumer products
when we think enterprise case actually different user case said choice different case enterprise consumers te basically decided order build product wanted make set core decisions (which included splitting video text chat different apps start scratch one area new approach duo allo based friends phone numbers  google accounts
as far core messaging experience allo goes pretty straightforward allo feature got biggest applause unveiling ability make text appear bigger smaller (to shout whisper press hold send button drag i think allo exciting feature  does allow add bit personality chats

talking personality apple went lots corporate partnerships likes disney nintendo google opted working independent artists stickers allo currently just  sticker packs allo themes range pack features alcoholic moody sloth ones feature partying marshmallows otto octopus stella starfish sad puppy style reminiscent edgier animated shows comedy central packs available free
you course send images (and draw share location dictate text
all table stakes  fox pretty agrees messaging used billions people people think messaging solved problem told  way actually think cusp new generation messaging apps think smart messaging
what makes allo different integration google machine learning smarts google assistant
i think google assistant conversational version google basic forth google started understanding pronouns google assistant takes new level
there ways work google assistant (which officially preview allo simply chat directly just like friend bring conversation typing @google asking question
when start chatting google assistant directly it’ll politely introduce ask use device location examples like google tell weather lets set timers alarms reminders ask general questions use latest news specific news person event (and subscri daily updates ask nearby restaurants flight delays standard queries likely familiar google play trivia game feel like confessional mode tell assistant things too
ideally results conversation assistant hit current limits pretty quickly ask question topic does know assistant returns link web site point conversation simply ends
the ideal conversation basically nearby sushi restaurants listings sushi restaurants  mi ones open listings shogun sushi  mi directions there and directions step allo presents tappable options too
for chatting directly assistant does  live potential easy  useful gets smarter time
where assistant does come handy chats people easily pull google search restaurant looking group example want directions somebody
while support google assistant probably marquee feature allo use smart replies  canned pre written responses  familiar google inbox  interesting work really chatting assistant feature often pull useful follow questions  just chatting friend it’ll regularly pull just right response worst case scenario means end having conversation friend really just bots talking  ideally response would’ve typed save taps (which especially useful go
smart replies works photos when your friends send pictures babies save typing obligatory oh cute!

by default chats allo encrypted using standard protocols allo does incognito mode turn chats end end encrypted advantage features like discreet notifications does message content standard mobile notifications message expiration message auto deletes set time set  seconds week
the obvious question google did turn features default fox tells chat end end encrypted features like smart replies google assistant simply ca work google algorithms ca not see content chats people just  want think important users choice fox told me
and given users choice chances friends wo  allo just app allows kick message sms client chat  android users google introducing new feature called app preview messages friend gets notification ability to write line response just like chat app installed android message include link download allo course
google strategy messaging confusing past hopefully focus specialized apps end time especially hangouts does  enterprise/productivity app i understand google reasoning launching set apps  personally i seen company build features like google assistant hangouts app (and i assume actually future
to  fair assistant preview i’d like bit smarter though when gets right great user experience   step outside comfort zone better just doing regular search browser fox rightly noted reason preview right noted that reason meant work google home google apps market feature assistant support allo app features assistant cross service functionality remains limited
still allo competent messaging app gets all its core features right i switching hangouts chatting friends family (though i miss fact built voice calling feature yet
