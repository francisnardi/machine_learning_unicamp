rough round edges 
prisma video ios just beta launch stage airapetyan touting improvements quality coming pipe expanded choice of art filters style clips  adding intention to make all prisma photo processing styles available video and add new ones too
they are not punch art filtered video  startup photo processing app picsart got there before (in picsart case siloing video processing into a second standalone app called magic video
 airapetyan dismissive rivals efforts faster better taking account fact launching videos beta final quality  better he argues asked how prisma video stacks picsart take
we’ll increase photo styles quality couple weeks adds
it fighting talk  prisma clearly now having play catch the competition thanks early viral success
at beta stage quality prisma video also has rough edges polished looking results possible magic video   personally i prefer simpler prisma interface vs toggles layers available in magic video ( prefer greater choice of editing options tools you’ll likely disagree
in quick test prisma video ahead new feature launch i results looked little crude immediately appealing vs prisma art filtered photos  tendency producing flickery footage
that said the art photos different prisma filters yield pretty radically different results look better than you’ll want spend time playing different styles
i typically style that looked interesting entirely pleasing certainly fun   instant viral potential vs snap share gratification art filtered selfies
here couple more test clips i  using ‘gold fish’ ‘the scream’ filters respectively
and longer form video music group tweed apparently incorporates prisma tech (  note  app hard stop  seconds video going  able create as long form using just prisma just yet…
for video photos prisma app does offer granular controls processing picsart apps  prisma simplicity the viral appeal imo nor does prisma require register just process photos…  sure horses courses  want fully featured image editing app prisma it
looking purely photo filter effects i personally prefer prisma results  finding picsart results generally garish  matter personal taste
despite   single feature focus prisma continues rack downloads it tells techcrunch had around  million downloads point just months launch
back august running at m+ downloads  app early popularity attracted speculation summer te would raise vc funding developing  snapped social platform giant like instagr snapchat keen to beef own in house content creation talent
in event prisma instead it has started monetizing usage via sponsored styles available apps
currently has one sponsored filter launched (called gett slated coming later month te does accept big outside investment
i think ok adds airapetyan responding direct question are raising funding  new kid block app millions downloads  social sharing platform bunch of copycats seeking eat lunch turn cool feature sustainable business remains  seen
