planning wedding right moving job hunting stressful things you’ll life i know i’m getting married  days
so y combinator startup joy approached intelligent wedding planner startup i eye storm using popular wedding site theknotcom
both sites  many free wedding planning platforms  aim help organize smooth event including picture gallery guest list manager link registered love story information event itself

joy does  incorporates assistant help navigate provides customizable designs app updating info tools handling real life event ability guests upload photos share big screen reception
joy founder vishal joshi got married nearly decade ago wedding sites really thing just idea joy came working microsoft friend (and founder michael bach sister getting married vented frustration process then they roped kaiwalya kher (who ado time help them and soon started thinking site social connection platform guests
we actually send push notification entire guest list day getting married joshi told techcrunch
that  helpful getting people rsvp challenge you’ve planned big event you’ll know vendors want know guests going provide food drink staff hand handle sending push notification rsvp’d remind coming event parking info  fantastic theknotcom does do

guest list management easy platforms i’ve tested thing joshi says actually complicated problem says intensely focused fixing issue platform month half
the space talking impossible problem everybody said joshi told use similar slack magic link sign handle guest list
theknotcom handles list giving choice lock leave guest list manager open lock  invite event guest list just came site obviously nightmare bride groom want randoms just showing private events guest asked participate
however problem  complicated lock invite site forces rsvp using exactly typed invitation  proved  confusing parents older friends people tried sorts things like add spouse use nickname add kids rsvp hyphenate usually hyphenate thing far proved  mess we’ve send step step instructions add people manually
so hopefully joy figures out
it wo order flowers tailor dress right bartending service handle reception management like irl wedding planner  trying i say ui slick live slideshow nice touch joshi joked platform bit like intelligent bridesmaid telling bring umbrella going rain
joy understands context joshi said  she’ll  there
