bagging lots of users challenge startups y combinator  winter batch worrying bit average the man strong founder te of thunkable is coming comfortable position having fostered community million strong  thanks to the drag drop app builder interface helped developed mit years ago the core tech the pair aiming build a business on
and those millions users locked new tool  people signed month launching free app builder clear path encourage over more old users  and bring on new ones too
so fork original mit project success mit app inventor meant outgrown resources afforded academia say thunkable co founders arun saigal (ceo weihua li (cto
hence decision to seek commercialize core technology new building atop mit open source code new features hope support their intention to monetize line (to  clear thunkable code  open source  say hope community contributions future
while mit app inventor original target was educators students offering free learning tool lower barrier entry coding pair say success software  used make  million apps point garnered  million registered users  called spinning the academic setting
the original goals app inventor basically make tool teach people code lab worked mit invented lot drag drop programming tools  worked scratch lego mindstorms tools like says saigal from started growing quite bit mainly education lot outside education
when app inventor growth hit  monthly active users te decided stock surveying users to ask using result surprise majority (over  cent fact educators  realization let consider the potential of transforming an educational resource business
in fact says saigal discovered sorts people using software build sorts apps  individuals wanting make app control connected led light home way enterprises using to put apps sales teams
the te mit fielding more feature requests app inventor users  did resource serve requests both demand potential growth clear
we saw huge range actually majority users education users started sending ‘hey build ‘can build that’  obvious things monetization ability add google maps like features we scope app inventor says saigal
it point realized supporting users b evolved way past initially imagined… evolved largest app creation tool non programmers 
other app builder tools exist of course including likes bizness apps and appgyver outsourcing route companies hire external devs dev studios build apps option  expensive existing app builders  accessible non developers pair argue level coding knowledge  required
the claim thunkable  use computer build app says li  simply slotting together blocks code it uses simplify programming process
we tool anybody wants build apps  non developer highly skilled developer wants do quicker easier adds saigal
there parts tool explains designer is basically drag drop ui app say hey screen i want button i want text field i want sensors i want image ok great
then second blocks language programming language group invented  programming language sense click button drag ‘when buttonclick’ block programming language  end day meant  people necessary know code  sense logic
it concept coding  english friendly logical straightforward writing java language  adds
in old fashioned programming languages need to type in block language just building  just just use beauty using block programming language adds li grammar error free basically just piece blocks worry typos
if blocks fit compiles builds works fit does work adds saigal drag drop blocks type words start typing words blocks exist sure type ‘button click’ buttonclick block pop think thoughts blocks in

another advantage competing app builders saigal claims is apps built thunkable software are fully native web apps work offline able make use specific mobile hardware features gps nfc thunkable does offer some templates people want little structure started limited just building template apps  unlike competitors
there need download sdk build apps thunkable software works browser includes features designed appeal broad user base  ability live test app built user android phone

we live development feature connect phone browser developing actually app running live phone says saigal things people love new developer looking immediate gratification
given thunkable jumping point strong community built free software pair say plan keep offering a free version (thunkable currently entirely free foreseeable future monetization come freemium route building tiered pricing model basic free version they say likely  charging users certain extra features different pricing tiers based user is an individual sme large enterprise
at early stage thunkable just app inventor new they have added new features platform additions include extra sample apps templates support google maps enabling android material design features (which say mit te never had resources support
you come site obvious ui improvements thunkable vs app inventor buttons color scheme kind stuff we’ve improved past probably couple largest features we’ve added mit did support new android design stuff says saigal
thunkable supports material design new uis ripple effects things like that big upgrade users simple transfer projects say ‘wow app looks way nicer extra effort’
the te offering stepped support  responding (currently free email… chat online biggest things offer  actual human support work problems adds
the types features thunkable start charging monthly subscription fee future could  monetization capabilities apps built platform charging individuals   month right premium enterprise options  higher monthly subscription fees attached  as the ability enterprise customer to have white label version app lets host data includes support specific enterprise software
in terms timeframe flicking monetization switch say going  year  priority right building product growing users add
keeping app inventor community going  essential scaling business given million strong user base able to  sustained just dedicated mit staff how mit able support users with staff community power users chipped lot help support forums says li
and having strong customer support key plank thunkable proposition scaling a business needing hire large numbers of support staff  easily achieved likewise nurture strong engage community pull them
what happen mit app inventor entirely clear point  looks like development project wind future thunkable picking baton
the startup has funded a  seed yc far founders reckon rest year  saying they are in hurry raise round stage
as using funding hire more staff help scale business working building ios version product  currently supports building android apps an ios version become possible apple open sourced programming language swift december according saigal possible given mit limited resources
people asking ios version years finally investing time resources says adding hope early version ready end year  version launched time next year
beyond adding ios longer term goal thunkable evolve tool supports collaborative app development  like google docs allows multiple people easily work documents according to li
we want be for people build projects coding easy writing google docs long term strategy make tool enable empower user empower people build tools collaboratively says
i think  really powerful incentive young people learn coding just sparking ideas  turning ideas mobile apps that know yet
