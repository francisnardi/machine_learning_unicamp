nattch is mobile social network people tired digital noise found on mainstre social services  ads memes animated gifs videos cute cats point stuff  termed extraneous distraction the reason signed service learn friends lives trollface meme taylor swift gif
yet logging facebook pretty inevitably results going down the proverbial digital rabbit hole  looking food photos by a chef plating junk food look like fine dining watching video of chipmunk languorously stretching divan followed with a dog rides a bike cat perched guitar owner sings mention those ads friends oh look! rabbit snuggles puppy! cute!
nattch ejects this type of garbage content calls encouraging users share updates actual lives cute funny interesting stuff you’ve seen read internet stuff banned regime report button users police postings idea create ‘clean’ social network contains only real stuff relating to people lives kind like facebook facebook first started
the bootstrapping startup was actually founded in august  clean proposition just a(nother way share content founder mauri saavedra hails bolivia  based business argentina says led losing interest in project  it was relaunched month with new focus bare bones social networking  topical promise resulting time savings (see apple watch promises technology designed save time
i laying bed using facebook iphone spending couple minutes browsing news feed i start noticing stories i looking random stories things i did choose irrelevant life good story like six unrelated stories i did care says saavedra
it epiphany moment i remember thinking ‘i love place good stories i stop looking random things make waste time’ i spending lot time smartphone then so i said nattch built core idea i looking ‘a social network garbage’ that started
nattch is not social service to try grab traction anti facebook ticket course fall elloco snagged attention its ad free social network  went raise  million following month earlier year alternative social network added ability share music video clips ticking away offering users ad free space for sharing visual content plus status updates
 ello is still bit different nattch former is filled type content nattch dub ‘garbage’ pretty looking garbage sure  lot extraneous distraction mission is to friends actually doing thinking what they’ve happened stumble across on internet
so where ello content comes as rather pinterest ish character nattch is lot more quotidian photos view people window wake thought walked park  given just relaunched classing public beta  line social network reckons personal better
the core rules nattch club are
if saw video internet thought fun  share nattch related life followers  interested explains saavedra walking park vacations took photo park beautiful sky day share nattch photo living followers want know living
 nattch focus personal real world type social sharing (there location check feature instance app does allow users post content publicly nattch users view it share postings just people following  things little public
we truly recommend users follow people matter lives nattch invite want users follow  or  people news feed start scatter really important stories truly cares life people adds saavedra
that social structure seems bit consistent nattch is offering  path style limited friends social network thinking loud in public social network thinking people wo not know irl makes like twitter post  personal means frequency of posts probably  drastically reduced
look twitter feed count ratio personal postings vs party stuff rting just linking to/pointing many people skew tweeting still again nattch point social network trying generate unnecessary noise so does want a constant flow stuff eyeball but getting users realize slow smell digital roses paradoxically time/getting used  we’ve conditioned expect filter streams colorful if impersonal content linger thoughtful postcards
like ello nattch does ads  plan monetize yearly subscription  la whatsapp   nattch costs  as a paid download which covers years subscription
nattch is a nice idea increasingly noisy world times feel like hovering brink of distraction fatigue given demands placed attention smartphones the social services pimp  whether nattch quieter channel can build traction remains  seen channel check charging small fee app download especially competitive space puts high barrier adoption
it questionable nattch users  kept line sharing ‘right’ type content clean environment does lot of pollution muddy its waters person trash person treasure
still apps technologies trying trade the promise reduced distractions emerging growing theme worth noticing
