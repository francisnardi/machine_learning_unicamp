just year ago alex roetter took twitter engineering activities executive shuffle year later twitter middle finding new ceo
 stopped company continuing following strategy ceo dick costolo roetter place continue building company engineering te launch new products pretty simple approach  hire best engineers small agile teams little structure roetter said
twitter complex problem filled tons information coming company sift data surface best information amid figure new ways make easier approachable new users interesting engineering problem fact ceo transition given twitter problems bringing new engineers roetter said
we caught roetter week hear bit twitter engineering te little bit atmosphere twitter right lightly edited transcript conversation
tc where twitter terms engineering focus priorities priorities
alex roetter i’ve job year i’m maniacally focused building environment world class engineers can best they’ve in their careers way know it working we’ve seen massive acceleration pace execution seeing bunch signs far  course ways build stable culture where you basically really stable vision really strong teams tools jobs done
twitter know total audience strategy twitter really great broadly appealing universally interesting content today use app content twitter future broader mean reach happen   logged party app syndicate site  having stable strategy important executing vision teams that started working year
tc archetype engineers looking teams
ar the model i try great people empower bare minimum structure need structure great things like setting clear direction explaining important company really want use structure sparingly possible try build teams thrive environment clear direction  details unspecified teams able try bunch things fail fast hold accountable measure rigorously smaller teams faster try build sort environment direction specific things try left bottoms up
as result philosophy look people extremely technically strong people run in gaps unspecified problem run make work look say ‘i’m paralyzed’ look people projects open source projects school projects look cultural fit
tc how reconcile need bring relevant content casual users users wanting reverse chronological timeline primary interface
every time open twitter best stuff  alex roetter
ar i think mutually exclusive continuum people today curated follower lists open app really frequently twitter works really app return people need make dramatic changes 
 end spectrum are people know relatively little app effective as it could  time open twitter best stuff gonna try different fits different parts that spectrum think room exist we’ll learn asking targeted questions observing their behavior core users want change good product new wave lot better  to dig know right moment open phone
tc technical challenges like that
ar twitter giant info retrieval problem example ‘while away’ special case i know you’ve historically twitter features you’ve used need instantly score content i possibly rank it feedback real time dismiss tweet we ask helpful  expanding tech challenge gets harder time twitter pull phone think twitter immediately considering content twitter history content internet digesting figuring to work globally  fault tolerant

tc i seen fail whale recently guys attacked problem
ar i’m glad you’ve noticed large distributed systems problem split app bunch independent services talk run bunch tests fails degrade gracefully ‘i i  omit thing service fails service just falling entirely twitter bursty right  events twitter double sigma events orders magnitude heavier load testing auto injecting failures know we’ll  able handle things split lot work  paying off
tc and guys working on front
ar better ways handle spikes better ways  able slowly make experience little worse users cases heavy load rather just falling uptime solved   level work ranking twitter content getting timeline want make sure works
another thing work  obvious  want engineers fast possible bare minimum process  having automation catch problems break something
tc does twitter code reviews
ar yep code goes production gets reviewed fundamental principles we believe high quality work catching quality sharing knowledge best practices making sure investing reinventing wheel and serving teaching mechanism
tc things ceo search process started
ar i say shortest business usual stuff i talked about total audience strategy finding great people wins you’ve seen like fabric away bunch strategy conceived ago those
the good news twitter interim ceo jack dorsey chairman board fully board confidence te knows really continuing execute accelerate the pace people feel good people know jack reason i think exciting time answer question best stuff twitter impactful bigger company today
tc ceo transition effect recruiting
ar no transition specially exclusively world class engineers they’ve  lot options recruiting i spend lot time  great thing able bring tons of really strong new peoplenandini ramini to run engineering effectiveness te making sure tools  successful vp platform engineering chris pink ran parts amazon runs backend new york engineering lead vijay pandurangan engineering lead project lightning
 recruiting live competitive environment case dick jack ceo just life  right people twitter amazing opportunity  bigger company  needle  startup thing attracts people work  billion public company company realized small fraction  examples individuals coming changing trajectory of company in short period time compelling story
tc what best story dorsey
ar he just started doing does square  send raw unedited notes multi hour staff meeting entire company interesting hyper transparent summarized raw bullets exposes interesting things working sections like challenges missing i think really interesting idea pioneered making sure company understands we’ve just week far i’ve heard gets really good results anecdotally
tc guys view problem advertising relevance right now
we send raw unedited notes multi hour staff meeting entire company… hyper transparent summarized raw bullets alex roetter
ar i was of the earliest engineers on ads te i involved ads years ranking problem it an information problem philosophy is want ads users marketers add value process twitter makes money  computing content based interests activities  i i learn correction factors things depending quality kind user similar sorts things taking applying timeline iterative improvement process day google started search good today iterate forever we’ve improved ad ranking algorithm constantly for years doing thing organic well

ar goes ranking model we’ll make different predictions based things users mark offensive engage organically hard coded rules it
tc technical problems associated ads
ar real time high velocity large scale ranking problem  want  able better job  i better job i data able optimally match content ads  really great ads poorly  really annoying include all real time components thing we’ve learned tradition ad systems real time signal really important did ranking got better measured real world user behavior
tc anything  want add
ar stuff starting pay site pace product development accelerated thing i think exciting twitter thing helps attract realization opportunity of twitter bigger rejigger product little unlimited upside people come work small minimal teams try new things
