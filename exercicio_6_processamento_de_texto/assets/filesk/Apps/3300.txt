mobile messaging eating world follows that mobile messaging interfaces eat ui design wit meet stepes chat based translation app created veteran software localization company csoft for chat based read mobile messaging style ui (for recent example messaging interface appropriate dojo labs
csoft drawing  years+ translation services expertise including crowdsourced glossary industry/topic specific nomenclature called termwiki launched years ago circa  translators books so stepes typical startup  new venture by old (in tech terms translation software company drawing on some minute app interface trends tackle a specific problem
that problem deliver translation services smartphone  unlock potentially massive market bi/multilingual people grow number translators available demand translation work (and grow overall size translation pie
instead stepes just targeted at the circa  professional translators says currently working field csoft eyeing like half world population (aka total number bi/multilingual people potential users its app so yeah pretty ambitious stuff
yet look hundreds millions users mobile messaging platforms like whatsapp managed acquire and the logic thinking  pro translator  able apply language skills translate snippets text bit downtime phone hand people surely do
making app easy  speak language use translate text demand they fixed using a mobile messaging interface says carl yao stepes vp global strategy development app supports text speech users necessary need  able type translation job platform
on demand csoft rational is plenty smaller businesses like  able localize content  did cost time money so translation expensive difficult get… stepes making translation process easier think going unlock pent demand translation argues
csoft started work stepes around march year settling using a mobile messaging interface months  trying figure make translation workflow viable mobile devices translating large amounts text small screen demands bite sized approach reckons yao while making translation accessible generally means simplifying tools
all previous translation software desktop based means available mobile lot software tools increasingly difficult use html tag manipulations text formatting requirements… really making translation process difficult just anybody says
stepes makes translation available mobile time makes translation task easy  think big new advancement… makes translatable text just like normally chat message  just straightforward sentence tags worry about
it took long time figure adds thinking fact type long emails mobile… thing writes dissertations mobile lot translation software companies just bother mobile  think ca  address issue come viable solution make sure translation experience good efficient
csoft filed multiple patents try defend approach including app swipe gestures  let users messaging bubble showing current sentence translating view that text context surrounding sentences document (swiping way proximate sentences they’ve translated overall translation quality does end chopped little pieces too
mobile suddenly makes translation process intuitive argues yao efficient
stepes launching today android ios app shortly  currently review apple windows version planned future
as existing translation business models pricing translations a per word model word rates vary depending factors like target language subject field yao saying range c c word vary depending long translator working platform better rates people who clock years translating stepes
how stepes ensure quality translations given opening platform  claims speak language just professional translators demand approaches built review  translators rated job complete helping surface better translators platform
this like crowdpolicing good job  ranked low… stepes linguists going really  paying attention submit know ranked translation identity connected good job  ranked low  translation accuracy slow performance time performance think important driving factor improved quality says
yao argues opening non professional translators  subject matter experts certain fields  they  professional engineer doctor example  help raise quality translations when having specific expert knowledge might be helpful specific translation task
the users understand subject matter better professional translator argues ( remains  seen doctors/engineers time/incentive small time translation jobs spare time  presumably time  uber drivers outside work hours…
while csoft is hoping push stepes to  professional translators books it will  doing pre screening new sign ups  including screen translation test  eye quality platform ongoing selective reviews where a translation be automatically reviewed second translator professional category says yao
translators  paid completed translation jobs app wallet  various transfer options ability withdraw paypal customers paying documents translated stepes  able log desktop version platform translation happening real time (if curious
of course plenty free online machine translation apps  google translate   yao says company concerned competition algorithms given that so translation requires cultural background nuanced context languages machine translation does exist (he notes  languages just india instance
and stepes target small business customer base wo not want to push poor quality translations at their customers words never ask a machine translate document crowdsource a human instead
i’m confident machine translation good destroy crowdsourced translation business… biggest challenge machine translation data says  having data certain extent going help quality anymore data gets contaminated machine translation number enemy contamination machine translator does know right wrong
so impossible immediate future machine  able match human translation
