concerns raised scope a data sharing agreement google owned deepmind and the uk national health service (nhs revealed agreement covers access wide ranging patient data london hospitals involved targeted subset of data relating specific medical condition healthcare app question (streams focused on
back february deepmind announced a collaboration nhs build app clinicians treating kidney disease company also acquired existing early stage clinical task management app called hark built te imperial college london  evidently intention building base tech  giving more specific medical focus instance
the streams app aims streamline alerts access to patient data for doctors nurses working line medical care  general medical data alerts messaging platform is specifically focused single use case detecting cases aki (acute kidney injury
at the time announced project deepmind founder mustafa suleyman said aki accounts  deaths annually uk  quarter said estimated  preventable
streams deliver right data right clinician exactly right time really objective try shift  activity hospital today reactive activity pro active ultimately preventative said at the launch
this course cutting edge analytics machine learning comes prioritize series alerts doctor nurse identify which person on clinical te  receiving the right data and ensure they’ve followed good time
however late week new scientist obtained data sharing agreement deepmind royal free nhs trust operates hospitals estimated  million patients treated annually the agreement shows deepmind health gaining access to all admissions discharge transfer data accident & emergency pathology & radiology critical care hospitals
it also includes years historical medical records data patients treated at the hospitals the data sharing agreement deepmind set run september   document specifies data be transferred nhs trust residual data  destroyed
the data question stored processed deepmind office  held contracted party (whose redacted document
deepmind staff undergone information governance training signed confidentiality agreement employment specified authorised users data
consent patients use the royal free nhs trust have their data shared google owned company implied nhs caldicott information governance review regime  meaning nhs trusts need explicitly seek consent share data ( patients opt any information sharing agreements non nhs organisations contacting trust data protection officer assuming know existence data sharing agreement place
criticism agreement focused deepmind needs access patient data given their app apparently targeted specific medical condition (ie aki
there wider critical point consider trade offs having large commercial entity (deepmind parent google/alphabet gain access  albeit indirectly particular instance  sensitive highly valuable (and ultimately taxpayer funded medical data
on hand entirely possible clinical outcomes patient care be improved money agility private companies society comfortable letting profit driven companies lead in public health affording them access value data sets  potentially chaining benefits commercial sector foreseeable future
meanwhile resourced public sector research efforts   motivated share gleaned health insights broadly  left labour in the rear
one critical voice raised against the deepmind data sharing agreement health data privacy group medconfidential particularly concerned about why royal free trust data streams shared for all patients than just for those kidney function tests
phil booth coordinator group points nhs data sharing agreements require statement particular data required google need data entire hospital why data tests tells techcrunch patients having tests patient medical history available direct care need else
their answers add up
deepmind declined  interviewed topic members review board did not respond requests comment update one deepmind appointed ( unpaid reviewers mp julian huppert responded saying asked data scope issue  discussed panel meeting assure data access actually  used
in particular i want  absolutely clear sensitive information  used parts google deepmind stick commitment ‘privacy security protected times told techcrunch
there potentially huge advantages improving way health uses data data used help faster efficiently using aggregate data make predictions misuse sensitive data  hugely problematic potential privacy intrusion i want maximise benefit minimising risks
a spokeswoman deepmind provided following canned statements response requests interview
a spokesman royal free which was reachable telephone told techcrunch reason deepmind provided with access patient data account aki affecting large proportion of patients  condition having a clear set particular signals/symptoms associated meaning early detection requires drawing on a lot data
acute kidney injury affects patients used treat people specific kidney conditions used spot likelihood acute kidney injury occurring in patient way does just assessing blood test results  looking patient history patient records said
it undoubtedly convenient argument advancement deepmind ai based ambitions nature specific medical condition kicked off its healthcare app efforts apparently requires access hospital patient data  example people admitted hospital abortion say drugs overdose who arrived a&e after falling stairs breaking leg
but the spokesman royal free trust asserted that handing data necessary order app function effectively particular instance
it specifically abortion data example… just patient  fully assessed likelihood acute kidney patient records analyzed said
the point way algorithm works sub set relevant patient data algorithm uses kinds data make judgement clear sub set data thing indicates somebody acute kidney injury just personal blood test results personal results type person looks medical history makes judgement  makes algorithm effective
techcrunch also contacted royal free trust patient data protection officer comment update post response
deepmind confirmed point performing any machine learning/ai processing on the data receiving  company clearly indicated like future note website pertaining to this ambition reads
the royal free spokesman said it possible current data sharing agreement trust deepmind company apply ai technology data sets data streams
that type processing data require agreement confirmed
the thing data is direct patient care added used research like that
however quite nhs trust hope maintain control future ai algorithms deepmind create  trained off insights gleans original public data set  unclear
another critical point note private companies provided access sensitive public data sets required  accountable decisions actions public  deepmind feeling entirely comfortable declining multiple requests  interviewed media topic
and new scientist pointed it has hide use nhs data secretive public health data does combine high handed secrecy does provide necessary public reassurance private sector motivations comes to handling processing hugely sensitive public data sets short deepmind/google needs learn improve bedside manner wants win patients hearts minds
