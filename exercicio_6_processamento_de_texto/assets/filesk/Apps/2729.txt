at point supporting  languages app lets specify primary language secondary on
i able test basic typing wrio honeycomb supports different color themes user customization is still roughly qwerty layout  identical it will certainly slow initially
that said radically different keyboard layout disruptors does feel immediately alien willing  bit patient about retraining fingertaps feeling need rage quit minutes actually pretty impressive attempt reconfigure qwerty habits lifetime die hard
as claims reducing typos keys certainly feel bigger (with exception space bar/keys possible typing accuracy could  improved time  probably your individual typing/tapping style dual spaced space keys  acquired taste
