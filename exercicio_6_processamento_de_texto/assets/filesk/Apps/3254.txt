around ten years ago jules urbach sitting table mom house coding away knock door mom answered  visitor directors jj abrams david fincher questions a rendering technology urbach working potential make movie scenes look realistic shorter load times
abrams fincher were being prescient urbach building  used films like avengers and commercials transformers money mom place
urbach started company called otoy short online toys  otoy specializes rendering complex d environments using cloud based servers making making easier  faster  build scenes video games movies now otoy integrates unity unreal engine  biggest tools used game developers world
these kinds integrations help companies offload complex technological aspects things like rendering games making easier focus gameplay art assets instead octane  company tool can export unreal engine unity applications directly cloud  easily shared web and apps  streamed virtual reality devices like gear vr
normally takes tremendous time render properly  urbach goal cut seconds did finding way transfer rendering technology gpus increasing speed worked  slicing time required render scenes fraction used be and otoy raised  million financing course lifetime
it like photoshop understands light real world works urbach said need tricks  visual effects studio master and look real looks real  all physics goal tech rendering  ready projects like transformers and fraction cost octane  can render like video game
here example technology works imagine taking mesh forest video game character walking render lighting properly  make forest look lifelike especially character walks  normally takes tremendous time computing incredibly difficult real time  goal of octane to essentially make it possible look angles lighting shading visuals looking correctly lifelike real time

urbach says switching processes gpu speeds rendering time  times  times faster all helps scenes environments essentially render real time having record scenes frame frame the advantage of  rendered remote servers like amazon aws allows game developers artists scale need (the company demos running site
should  successful kind technology  a holy grail virtual reality augmented reality rendering basically  real time user pans head looks angles environment surrounding perfect world urbach says building holodeck star trek  real time holographic environment shifts changes way person looking matterport example capture inside apartment use octane correctly render lighting things like furniture user pans looks various parts apartment
this something i spent years college trying to master with a paintbrush mastered algorithm founder alissa grainger said met renderings face mom living room coffee table rendering skin exact way i did i portrait artist using watercolor
with technology essentially provide mixed environment  pre rendered streaming  developers example forest  pre rendered saved device  people changes  cloud servers streamed making experience look life like real time
urbach started path played dragons lair interactive cartoon game basically film requires controller input determine hero action  player puts wrong input hero dirk ends killed squid dropping death time scene previously animated  making feel like live cartoon game sort live entertainment fascinated urbach wanted build technology himself
if played thing ’ way i did blew mind ways things said video game looks absolutely perfect holy grail i basically kept asking mom buy arcade machine probably thousands dollars expensive i said ‘i’m gonna build thing myself
historically company sold application  recently shifted moving offering subscription based model like publishing services like photoshop helped company lured autodesk investor urbach said
for otoy business funded hollywood endeavors  working films like avengers and commercials transformers doubt helped by the company connection ari emmanuel icon entertainment industry sits company board advisors urbach task building marketing materials transformers  used testing ground technology
i remember told transformers film model takes  hours render frame i able really good quality i rendering  frames second at k urbach said happened time quality octane pretty better final output films 
still significant hurdles  typified bumpy road encountered predecessors game streaming space canonical onlive video game service streamed games like youtu videos computers fully playable  good internet connection gaikai example  brighter shortly after emerging promptly snapped sony technology exists form playstation subscription based gaming service similar onlive onlive slightly early properly capitalize technology  otoy pushing boundaries too
abrams checks periodically urbach mom things going
that big validator i’ve met big director like david fincher incredibly interested said i really credit guys helping pursue push future helps filmmaker like abrams excited working on
