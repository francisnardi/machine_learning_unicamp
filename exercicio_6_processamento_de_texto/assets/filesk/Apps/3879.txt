a few months ago i shared friends i think apps like magic operator going  big thing what makes special use traditional ui means interaction instead entire app revolves single messaging screen called invisible conversational apps initial post slew similar apps came market facebook recently released m personal assistant integrated messenger help just anything
while apps operate slew different markets checking bank account scheduling meeting making reservation best restaurant travel assistant thing common place messaging center stage

matti makkonen software engineer passed away couple months ago guess did hear death likely know makkonen probably important individuals domain communications i mean  on level alexander bell  important he invented sms
if did realize pervasive sms  think sms used application world years ago estimated  billion active users was more times numbers facebook users time messaging particularly sms slowly taking world fundamental human communication messaging apps whatsapp wechat worth billions
while messaging  central everyday lives currently used narrow context personal communications extend messaging messaging transform way interact computers way transformed way interact other
in recent movie ex machina billionaire creates ava female looking robot endowed artificial intelligence test invention brings young engineer fall love her
the premise movie centered turing test test invented alan turing (also featured recent movie imitation game to determine if artificial intelligence equivalent human robot passing turing test huge implications humanity mean artificial intelligence reached human level
while far creating robots look act like humans ava we’ve gotten pretty good simulating human intelligence narrow contexts contexts ai performs best guessed messaging
this thanks deep learning process computer taught understand solve problem having engineers code solution deep learning complete game changer allowed ai reach new heights previously thought  decades away nowadays computers hear read understand humans better opening world opportunities ai powered apps entrepreneurs rushing
in gold rush messaging low hanging fruit possible forms input digital text direct text constant does carry superfluous information forms communication voice gestures furthermore messaging makes better user experience traditional apps feels natural familiar
when messaging  ui need deal constant stre new interfaces filled different menus buttons labels explains current rise popularity invisible conversational apps  reason care goes that
the rise popularity apps recently brought startling observation advances technology especially ai increasingly making traditional ui irrelevant i dislike i believe technology progress eventually make ui tool past longer essential human computer interaction good thing
one argue conversational invisible apps devoid ui require screen chat interface true apps require ui design extent i believe just tip iceberg new technologies potential disrupt screen entirely point look following videos
the video showcases project soli small radar chip created google allow fine gesture recognition

the second presents emotiv product read brainwaves understand meaning   bear   electroencephalography (or eeg short

while technologies completely magical they currently functional special common require ui computer input
as designer unsettling trend internalize world computers listen talk understand reply purpose user interface bother designing app manage bank account just talk directly human interface interaction entering world brain computer interface world digital telepathy coupled ai means input allow communicate directly computers need screen
in talk chi  scott jenson introduced concept technological tiller according technological tiller stick old design new technology wrongly thinking work term derived boat tiller long time main navigation tool known man cars invented having steering wheels mean navigation boat tillers

the resulting cars horribly hard control prone crash steering wheel invented added design cars  widely used designer valuable lesson a change context technology requires different design approach example new technology motor engine needed new design steering wheel make resulting product car reach potential
when technological tiller ignored usually leads product failures acknowledged solved usually leads revolution tremendous success company best understood principle apple invention iphone ipad

a technological tiller nokia sticking physical keyboard phone better design create touch screen digital keyboard

a technological tiller microsoft sticking windows xp tablet better design develop new finger friendly os

and i believe technological tiller sticking ipad screen new internet things thing good design avoiding screen altogether
learning technological tillers teaches sticking old perspectives ideas surefire way fail new startups developing invisible conversational apps understand understand ui product  scaffolding allowing access product avoiding scaffolding lead better experience definitively  avoided
so i believe ai taking uis obsolete visual designers soon be unemployed
not really far i know uis  needed computer output foreseeable future people use screens read watch videos visualize data furthermore nir mentioned great article subject conversational apps currently good specific set tasks safe think  case new technologies emotiv project soli game changing likely  good ui probably outperform specific tasks
what i believe new technologies going fundamentally change approach design necessary understand planning career tech future computers talk listen reply good are your awesome pixel perfect sketch skills going be
let be fair warning complacency ui designers tendency presume ui solution new design problem ai revolution force reset presumption means design interaction push leave comfort zone look bigger picture bringing focus design experience actual screen exciting future designers
