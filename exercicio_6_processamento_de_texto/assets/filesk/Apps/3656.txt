as summer travel season goes into swing travel app hopes new way experiencing physical spaces growing detour  immersive city guide app constructed around gps triggered audio smart witty narratives  expanding existing footprint san francisco austin cover new york international cities barcelona berlin london marrakech paris
as with the current selection guides downloading app  free users purchase individual tours    europe marrakech  sign a subscription with unlimited guides /year
the comes detour notably founded by groupon founder ceo andrew mason continues work on its bigger ambition business platform for  to create an immersive guide for a particular place mason tells aim private beta platform open end year broader expansion 
since detour launch almost a year ago startup has straddling sides business content creation specifically building catalog guides home market san francisco detour currently adding new tours rate month employing te sound tech engineers radio producers craft guides
it te people working sf content helping lay bedrock second business platform making future guides
the challenge mason describes producing audio guide months sourcing content  recording coding progress based location detour trying figure way using technology make process faster easier result  detour crowdsource content its app  mean more ideas gets produced in place
part inspired people responses detour launch mason says people writing offering ideas completely outside bounds offering says  doing disservice allowing create detours
a few pieces puzzle place
for example detour has created tool to transcri piece audio let edit actual audio file editing that written transcription (which frankly sounds cool and useful just detour you’ve gone task of editing audio
another piece code detour built lets producer progr music recorded sound spoken narrative writing transcription notation detour automatically shapes audio to sit spoken voice
to  clear detour does category startups create instant videos piece text instant articles press releases
there outcome talented people are required make detours  we’d like reduce technical requirement needed mason says reason employing staff create lot content house today explains trying understand happens brains
within context mason describes newest additions previews detour offer future new york content actually based audio essays created soundwalk (audio tours people normally audio tours some time ago
soundwalk has making low tech  high qualty outdoor audio walks mason notes detour essentially reissued older walks having run detour platform add group listening location triggers gave platform  deserved added
the walks european cities marrakech created house albeit by close associate mason aaron groupon employee mason actually credits thinking company created the guides working local producers city irreverent style detour created sf  walk london westminster example led fictitious whiskey swilling government bureaucrat called henry adeane (very close home husband senior civil servant  expect pace adding new guides cities detour san francisco
the content equation just hurdles detour faces technical aspects service right using gps essentially propel user tour draining battery  tours  battery life mason says constantly working ways reducing  such selective about gps engagement and optimizations in how maps rendered distributing battery load in a group   way here
this is concern anybody trying build mobile experiences espcially since sending people out wild need make sure battery lasts
he says ideal situation actually using phone concentrating instead  ca   controlled the beginning decided detour be a phone pocket experience entire experience headphones people do phone pocket takes care largest battery drain people who worst experiencees instagramming or playing angry birds time
another fact app ios needing add android app mason brutal awakenings says android important we thought  i hate detour roughly one people  group  using android handset group more chances ca detour strong weakest linkandroid coming later year says hopefully
when ryan wrote detour year described app content centric approach travel guides story telling experience fact based travel guide think american life personalised specific location narration moving regard  hard think detour correlates mason previous entrepreneurial endeavor sometimes mocked high minded offerings
 there is tenuous connection groupon detour think mainstays groupon catalog deals are experiences selling just products and beauty sessions  parachuting trips boat cruises other activities discovery fun think new activity also what detour trying bring users albeit with a interactive constant companion style
that brings mind detour competition  opportunities longer term business lot companies travel leisure sector focussing apps getting discovering cities biggies like tripadvisor rough guides vc backed startups like peek dojo long tail efforts look slick  information
detour tries set apart just information attempts immersive media experience
it just information experience mason says helping people walk  shoes form deeper connection people identify place
indeed does location based travel businesses competition detour trying oculus as competition says job make real world interesting again
