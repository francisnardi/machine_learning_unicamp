that i hunch facebook instagr preparing launch powerful set video editing tools make minute long clips actually interesting
while worried videos  interruptive clumsy sleek instagr photo feed people warmed instagr says video viewing time grew  just  months
meanwhile instagr started make solid revenue video ads launched   seconds  starting september  month  longer user videos felt unnatural watch letting users post minute long videos make longer ads blend better
basically people like video instagr longer user generated videos make easier instagr make money medium does instagr make people want watch  second videos bet finally offering video editing tools elsewhere
as right edit video instagr add multiple clips trim lengths add filter toggle sound stabilization select cover frame list popular editing features lacks lonnnnnnng
these tools inspire people point shoot pan amateur clips today  true instavideographers polished reels hold people attention dopamine inducing photos just flick away
instagr potentially release video editing tools app adding wildly popular roster includes hyperlapse timelapses layout collages boomerang gifs core app clean tools plenty room breathe space
alternatively bury main instagr app instagr did released granular photo editing tools normal filters adjust contrast warmth shadow tilt shift got rolled hidden away wrench icon distract slow novice photo sharers

honestly facebook needs tools instagr it embarrassingly outdated facebook video tool does allow multi shot tap record filters stabilization cover images video experience hardly evolved  years i called facebook obsolete despite video viewing insanely popular facebook growing order magnitude  billion video views day time period
