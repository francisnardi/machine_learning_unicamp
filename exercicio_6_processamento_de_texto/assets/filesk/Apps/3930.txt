mobile signal mapper opensignal has launched new app maps wi fi hotspots help device users in need connectivity fix  expanding network crowdsourced intel albeit related area (opensignal launched crowdsourced cell phone data weather mapping app 
the new app called wifimapper launches today ios android app month according founder ceo brendan gill
the app free initially draws database wi fi hotspots generated opensignal existing network existing app users
we’ve crowdsourcing data mobile network originally wi fi networks years we’ve getting  million downloads application notes gill adding think we’ve assembled biggest databases wi fi networks there
there are already scores wi fi hotspot mapping apps vying attention app store  firstly aforementioned scale gill says makes opensignal wifimapper stand out compared wi fi apps scale data we’ve got really larger claims
the opensignal app active user base stands  million globally users apps feeding data new wi fi hotspot mapping app  claiming its database contains  million hotspots
the big differentiator gill points wifimapper ability distinguish free wi fi vs paid hotspots related context app is shading  tell free wi fi hotspot cafe bar instance opensignal meshing data foursquare location review data provide added context according to gill
we’ve built intelligent algorithms try actually classify wi fi  say we’ve got  million hotspots database actually useful users trick actually figuring ones free tells techcrunch
we’ve gone lot provide lot data users we’ve figured actual place database wi fi point attached actual place location type venue  cafe bar  comments venue we’ve cross referenced foursquare place database
opensignal wi fi hotspot measuring quality wi fi  differentiating factor in gill view 
our app continually tracking speed wi fi latency actual performance indicators goal long term just  definitive wi fi database  best free comfortable fast non congested wi fi hotspots i think that apps really doing adds
figuring wi fi hotspot free (or via clustering algorithms parsing host signals (no pun intended location  bar cafe vs office residential property  likely  free instance taking wi fi network consideration opensignal detects direct post login gill notes  indicator payment gateway
and tried lot automatically post launch  engaging users crowdsourcing wi fi intel
the crowd curate automatic algorithm think believe long term combination machine learning algorithm we’ve built engaged set users tweaking database bit going cleanest best free wi fi database adds
at launch wifimapper users  pushed using opensignal cellular data tracking app  drawing revenue moment (selling anonymized network quality intel telcos  gill says wants long term  albeit likely offer wifimapper users option to opt out contributing cellular data
i think line blurred comes wi fi mobile network signal quite similar think going  good overlap kind people like curate wi fi like submit data mobile network signal strength  ideally long term like unite communities  very transparent way giving users granular control data contribute adds
while wifimapper free download gill adds that opensignal look monetize it directly in future offering app purchases additional features  offline access hotspot maps  useful travelers wanting locate connectivity having enable cellular roaming
beyond grander vision boosting contextual app awareness opensignal working here
part vision working understanding sensory data trying  really intelligent actually potential data  area really getting contextual awareness recognizing user based wi fi hotspot think interesting data  used make intelligent applications understand wi fi hotspot  cafe cinema  just providing additional intelligence app knows actually based context says gill
we data valuable like build intelligent products using data adds things free ads like that
opensignal raised  million funding round august expand te push tracking additional areas gill says currently looking funding
