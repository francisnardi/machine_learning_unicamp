the way technology shapes language fascinating colloquially cringeworthy (to wit ‘i bandwidth right now’… ‘let offline’… ‘i’d totally swipe that’… it a reflection our tools influence shape social interactions
the reverse true course technology platforms end moulded human users ways makers did envisage necessarily intend built the initial feature set structure
hashtags twitter and the retweet function essentially user generated instance people early access mvp grabbed baton ran  combination rough ready technology plus interested early adopters resulted something fascinating genuinely useful being created lesson times increasingly prescriptive algorithms
and yes as a counterpoint gaming social platforms hate speech groups bent using reach mainstre social media amplify fringe agendas silence targets abuse ordinated bullying twitter now thinks it needs game deal kind corrosive service misuse
stepping there parallel lessons  drawn from people talking technology services interacting with not just general terms  like dislike service and  subtle linguistic choices might  expressing behalf reactions  evident language users are consciously articulating their feelings fully formed thoughts
one fascinating current example involves dating apps use particular phrase   going dark  to descri happens match stops responding say signaling users stops stops responding despite having been a degree of priorly stated mutual (one wonders jane austin might have interrogated such hinged moments
the developer behind machine learning tinder bot which hacks dating app automatically filter potential matches based the user prior aesthetic preferences used phrase in a blog about project  noting characteristic of dating app interactions encouraged add additional feature bot feature auto starts conversations sending pre set messages test waters automated primer will

it pitch perfect engineer fix actually far interesting social problem that dating apps exposing greater degree of social scrutiny increasing frequency of/encounters ‘dropping off’ behavior
‘going dark’ fact hints kind of social breaking point which apps stumbling cutting edge human emotional interactions digital equivalent mild snub social slight  very slight given public doled not yet strong ties to
the fact types apps make easier meet new people means necessarily follows users are going encounter higher volume of explicit social rejections than normally would and going dark phrase they have come descri an antisocial byproduct of using socially ‘catalyzing’ service  sting ‘i’m not/no longer interested’ signals
since dating apps enable surface connections  quickly logically follows responsible speedy social disconnections necessity coin phrase for now more commonly experienced behavior  ergo going dark
going dark view pretty great descriptor dating app foible characterizes other users pixels that can light ping flesh blood humans stopped responding actively snubbing course (probably are  point shows users taking sophisticated approach  throwaway interactions  account apps making easy engage randoms
in essence humans defusing subtle disconnections that such high volume of digital interactions inevitably entails all virtual social snubs really digital dating relations necessarily cheap given (yet deep
if cause concern going dark entering dating app user lexicon signify interaction overload people are swamped so many signals they feel unable respond politely match  resorting to switching messaging channel enable them to using app aka they are taking path resistance
(silence  tactful way say ‘no thanks prospective date  having explain length seem(ed interesting follow up signals struck interesting chord another example sort subtle social signaling play digital space way twitter users deploy the star feature word free meta communication method way say actually saying anything
the underlying concept of going dark brings mind the latest black mirror episode  black mirror being charlie brooker‘s satirical tv series imagines technology tools warp social interactions far flung future in holiday special screened christmas fictional story unfolds involving people who embedded cameras (called z eyes implanted into their eyes  enables activate advanced augmented reality functions filtering out the sight sound of particular individuals

another linguistic signifier technology failing appreciate nuance social interaction pejorative term ‘glasshole’  used brand and mark social censure users google (not fictional face computer glass
like fictional z eyes glass a hybrid device which uneasily straddles the digital physical worlds social unease it generates obvious amply explains consumers generally shunned (and google forced major rethink coining sensitive wording such as go dark descri glass influence on their social lives because consumers allowing it lives problems inherent with the technology writ large language does does coalesce it
developing products isolated separated from their social context crux here and the tldr linguistic alienation  symptom far greater disconnect
listen carefully to the language product generates and case of all dating app users flicking the kill switch matches flag potential service stress points  case glass surface tension of ‘glassholes  illuminate antisocial crux your abject failure
