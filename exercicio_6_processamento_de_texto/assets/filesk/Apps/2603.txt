the time consuming tedium file search is san francisco based startup peruse jumping off point aiming simplify locating files changing people search so they do remember exactly look exactly file called
peruse fix age old tech problem use natural language question answer interface narrow keyword search allow contextually relevant info simplify speed search it launching its saas enterprise search product today onstage techcrunch disrupt ny
founder luke gotszling describes as more human approach search so instance ask peruse locate powerpoints i edited week pdfs matthew panzarino sent  saving lot guesswork file named and likely reducing manual combing keyword file search results do
peruse plugs into existing cloud storage services requiring install (yet piece software type search peruse interface speak prefer  quicker easier
file search unsatisfying gotszling tells techcrunch i’ll type keywords keywords happen match i just list files basically things  basically things nowadays
for really unsatisfying and people think information i think  keywords match file exactly think things like ‘oh powerpoint i edited week
 worked medium sized company typically finds difficult locate information adds people used spending hours month just looking information
peruse natural language file search works for business documents file type albeit nlp tech only currently works english language service also initially limited documents stored box dropbox cloud storage repositories   intends to expand integrate services
that plank peruse second core feature works takes nl search capabilities further  deeper  allowing users search specific facts from inside a document rather having tech simply point to the file itself
the deep insights feature launched  peruse offering waiting list interested sign ups initially feature will work spreadsheets searches run in real time  spreadsheets background indexed peruse operating a wait list
who gotszling gives the example of a benefits company that deals lot small businesses needs to find annual hourly labor cost restaurant spreadsheet instead locating the file loading using control f approach try locate annual hourly labor cost figure peruse natural language tech parses indexed spreadsheet data to return answer specific query user having dive file all
so words is a machine reads spreadsheets (the does specify spreadsheet data located human and check
you say like ‘what cocktail sales bar tuesday' says gotszling detailing kind complex spreadsheet search query peruse tackle going control f going expect  label somewhere in fact looking information using traditional search methodology  difficult figure i search ‘cocktail sales i search ‘bar’ i search ‘tuesday’ i search ‘sales
in case multifaceted  hard know begin pick generic thing know  results paging  page spreadsheet information
there obviously limits spreadsheet reader software spreadsheet comprising only numbers without any text labels sign posting the data going  intelligently parseable   machine spreadsheets limited labeling may also trouble it
data represented different formats spreadsheet can also cause confusion  gotszling noting serve up multiple possible answers query (requiring human steps applies intelligence figure answer actually a proportion absolute value say
above the data want locate also  contained spreadsheet place  gotszling says peruse considering expanding feature support regular documents pdfs areas contemplating include te chat logs emails calendar entries confirmed though
also slate peruse future apple watch app i think like  particularly suited form factor says especially looking file  looking piece information inside file…  easily presented sentence i think work really well
right just going work spreadsheets adds built software tries understand type content way person understand it… try imitate visual understanding thing want people to reformat stuff works this
perhaps ironically machine readable understandable it built parses information way human would
gotszling says peruse building software particular industry mind  argues it suited analysis focused businesses hedge funds hr benefits companies dealing large amounts information need pick particular piece data large haystacks info (the nsa springs mind   clearly specialized data mining software
i’ve discussions with person said just scrolling spreadsheet takes minutes time generally people deal huge volumes information  resonated says gotszling
in terms competitive landscape plain old keyword search points microsoft power bi product specifically spreadsheets intelligence  suggests product is more focused visualization data retrieval couches ibm watson potential rival  adds i really seen tackle business documents technology  i certainly competitive
gotszling employee  aboutme worked infrastructure including structured search feature  evidently feeding expertise new venture bootstrapping building peruse prototype late october  ramping the hiring core te members past month
judges kanyi maqubela (collaborative fund minerva tantoco (new york city matt turck (firstmark capital yossi vardi (angel investor
maqubela i’m curious thought going mail things i interesting commonly i encounter use case
gotszling actually mail requested integration google drive that
maqubela going acquire customers
gotszling we’ll  available official app repositories box dropbox naturally people looking use box dropbox  able course target people users services advertisers methods build internal sales te needed
turck long history search companies individual search used  desktop search google discontinued… companies ’s s way enterprise search endecas… middle bunch companies trying cloud search position  large enterprise companies individual search early customers… tool tool smb uses it
gotszling i guess great thing need  hedgefund analyst use quetions information files smbs obviously good starting point easier  able use  stopping large company adopting internally obviously sales process lot different
vardi cloud servers desktops etc
gotszling feel good starting point potentially future index desktop  feel like millions users  businesses services good starting point  obviously expand future
vardi tell little bit yourself
gotszling i employee aboutme i actually did search product aboutme i’ve research neural enetworks i engineering background i’ve built te super talented people including people won international algorithm competitions content extraction nlp expert ex google engineer
vardi heads  revered internet companies personal model
gotszling i probably say google  founders
vardi want  google
gotszling potentially obviously  great  google  i’m trying think short term
tantoco talk bit natural language processing piece ai that lot companies starting talk about
gotszling just getitng started nlp like said companies doing i think things differentiates lot technology built house available shelf ca just grab open source product kind stuff i think really big makes us nlp terms specifics i really want talk particular implementation methods
maqubela starting price point
gotszling looking typical saas model  user month charges enterprise features analytics particular stringent security requirements provide assurances well
turck i’m trying hone makes special long history say ability structured data search opposed unstructured  ability use nlp run searches database
gotszling yes potentially we starting just regular files  file searches live question answering service starting spreadsheets… data repositories tap  nice  able ask question giant data warehouse type product having learn language email somebody company
turck i think  nice  able little thing makes  search companies trying penetrate market really need tip spear market i’m curious  doing file search like everybody sort claims  i’m just curious hear you going conquer market market trying conquer
gotszling initially search businesses  eventually depend initial beta customers want going drive product forward ultimately say really need this data warehouse going build them
jason kincaid train software super cool  i  wary trusting knows look sort thing telling explicitly
gotszling did train software ran spreadsheet having seen i able extract information… perfect occasionally make mistakes depending formating  did train it ran completely unsupervised able ask questions content
