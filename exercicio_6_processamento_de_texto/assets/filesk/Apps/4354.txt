blocks has long time getting drawing board  remains prototype stage years development   modular smartwatch concept has finally landed kickstarter in the uk based startup is hoping be the push idea market
backers putting money pre order the smartwatch offered an estimated shipping schedule   assuming te can raise  kickstarter fund the first round of manufacturing
the current status development engineering prototype (pictured tc logo uploaded core testing separate design prototypes test aesthetics ergonomics materials founder ali tahmaseb says test units embedded final design planned end december

the development core initial designs modules components selected modules prototype stage  electronics modules final product needs  produced tested adds discussing what development work outstanding stage

how confident it of delivering finished product  shipping schedule selected components designs reliable previously tested devices easy manufacture odm extensive experience bringing high quality consumer electronics market main innovation industrial design connectors communications te good estimate tahmaseb couches it
we covered blocks march  demoing video modular smartwatch concept was actually founded in november  students london imperial college right motorola outed project ara modular smartphone concept (the remains development house google te project recently delayed planned pilot launch til year  amply clear modular consumer tech development cake walk
blocks taiwanese manufacturer (compal signed piece of its modular smartwatch goes crowdfunded plan device consists core module (the watch face plus series individual strap links support additional functionality adding battery capacity gps navigation heart rate monitor idea user gets spec smartwatch requirements
there initial modules kickstarter funding phase aforementioned modules plus nfc contactless transactions adventure module output live readings for altitude pressure temperature appeal to outdoor sports types/hiking enthusiasts
the core blocks watch face module function standalone smartwatch  available kickstarter backers  paired basic watch strap (adding notifications centric smartwatch option crowded marketplace  wanting advantage blocks modularity  really usp late market point  need shell  (the early bird ks price core module plus additional modules link clasp form strap
the standard price module package is   positions blocks at higher end notification focused smartwatch market vs rivals pebble (pebble latest model pebble time round starts   entry level pebble costs  price point wise it not much cheaper polished premium wrist wear designed places like cupertino and korea apple watch starts  instance while samsung gear s starts 
given higher end price point blocks likely to face challenge carve fan base in already fiercely contested space  unless convince people novelty modularity worth taking punt wearable newbie
there constraints instance blocks notes people with smaller wrists ca accommodate its standard modules  users  device customizable potential  constrained just modules (ie addition core module  flip large wrist manage fit five modules (blocks says backers will  able specify functionality color any modules pre ordering later point
these modules apparently hot swappable you’d hope process removing them is touted easy go it plug play replaceable seconds need boot device tool required pin comes small push finger tahmaseb describes process

this summer startup confirmed using modified version android lollipop software base smartwatch google wear platform device is case designed  compatible android ios mobile devices te hoping build out an open hardware ecosystem   opening party hardware makers wanting build sell blocks modules planned blocks store future
we anticipate modules gaming sports healthcare workplace experimental ones academic research note such ambitions are of course dependent blocks managig build healthy user base its smartwatch order support ecosystem of developers  claim signed  interested devs ahead release their module development kit claims be already working large tech companies party modules
on apps app dev kit  coming  month device ships according tahmaseb says it making standard apps  such calendar alarm clock reminders notes voice memos activity tracking battery monitor module manager notification bar and is also intending reach mainstre party apps try ensure wares are available time launch  guarantees course
the theory modularity surface compelling offers prospect apparently outwitting upgrade cycle small additional financial outlay time practice cost partial upgrades would  highly competitive make worth users involved hassle managing mixed bag of bits bobs
add overall complexity modular proposition  vs offering pre packaged products clearly designed ready box experience  suggests likely appeal niche segment highly savvy tech users and/or people who want lot more control kit average user mainstre appeal unlikely   want stack modular contenders  modular smartwatch does seem an easier sell modular smartphone
another issue modularity robustness google ara apparently delayed electro magnetic links planned fix modules strong withstand the user dropping phone
blocks te does worry users dropping their product given  strapped wrists  smartwatch still needs to  robust withstand daily wear tear  mechanism securing and swapping modules very vital link chain line really need  confident engineering key piece
ultimately companies responsible conceiving designing products reuse recycling built in from beginning  circular economy that deliberately engineered minimize waste maximize resources  is ideal overall goal piecemeal product modularity  likes of blocks to be thinking outside built obsolescence box  designing user remake box discrete bits
