more details emerged sweeping scope google/deepmind ambitions pushing its algorithmic fingers deep the healthcare sector  including wanting to apply machine learning processing to uk nhs data years
new scientist obtained a memorandum understanding deepmind and royal free nhs trust london describes pair envisage broad ranging mutually beneficial partnership engaging high levels collaborative activity maximizing potential work genuinely innovative transformational projects
envisaged benefits collaboration include improvements clinical outcomes patient safety cost reductions  huge ongoing pressure point free point use nhs demand services continues rise government austerity cuts bite public sector budgets
the mou sets long list areas mutual pair dub future potential work together over the five year period collaboration envisaged in the memorandum document parts legally binding signed on january  year
potential areas future collaboration include developing hospital support systems bed demand management software financial control products private messaging task management junior doctors (on private messaging nhs staff informally using messaging apps like whatsapp quickly share information previously suggested as risk patient data confidentiality
they say want work together on real time health prediction  pair first effort (an app called streams focused  involving range of healthcare data try identify risk patient deterioration death and/or readmission
reading medical images even monitoring the foetal heartbeat a pregnant woman in labour listed areas interest
here relevant portion mou

the mou begins by referencing deepmind ability build powerful general purpose learning algorithms
it goes state deepmind hopes for the collaboration royal free nhs trust gain data machine learning research appropriate regulatory ethical approvals
the pair said designed app streams is not utilizing any ai powered by algorithms created deepmind  instead the core software was written by nhs
 scope mou makes clear applying machine learning public healthcare data is exactly the ambitions lie here
criticism personally identifiable data powering the streams app
back february deepmind announced working royal free trust  develop an app to targets particular kidney condition called aki it said the app streams would present timely information helps nurses doctors detect cases acute kidney injury
few details data sharing agreement google owned company royal free trust were public stage but it subsequently emerged that deepmind given access wide range heathcare data  million patients pass trust london hospitals year
the data question is patient identifiable (ie non anonymized non  pseudo anonymized agreement deepmind is also getting access patient data trust hospitals dating years
critics health data privacy group medconfidential questioned patient identifiable data is being shared for app targeting single condition
direct care patient clinician a doctor taking steps prevent patient having future problem direct care an organisation taking steps reduce future events unknown patients (eg fluoridation argues s smith medconfidential
the royal free trust deepmind continually maintained access wide range of data necessary streams app perform a direct patient care function given difficulty predicting patients are at risk developing aki
they continued assert app used purely for direct patient care not for research important distinction given that conducting research patient identifiable data likely required obtain additional approvals gaining explicit patient consent or section  assent (neither obtained
 claim data used for research they argue approvals necessary inevitable large proportion people data fed app directly benefit ongoing criticism
even factor medical uncertainties predicting aki  suggest you need cast your data collection net wide  question remains data patients blood test hospitals shared help identify risk aki
and why is some data sent monthly use case immediate direct patient care happens patients fall gap are risk effective ‘direct patient care’
responding critical questions techcrunch royal free trust asserted app direct patient care  providing the following statement flesh reasoning
given envisaged breadth of year collaboration deepmind royal free as set their mou fact the google owned company been afforded access wide range healthcare data looks far less surprising  owing to the similarly wide range of products pair envisage collaborating future
for example planning building software predict bed demand busy hospitals then access wide range patient data  as admissions discharge transfer data accident & emergency pathology & radiology critical care  going multiple years obviously  essential building robust algorithms
and exactly sort data deepmind getting aki data sharing agreement royal free
however course  necessary deepmind royal free gain correct approvals potential use cases envisaging mou
so unless unannounced data sharing agreements place pair wide ranging personally identifiable healthcare data which deepmind currently access specifically be for streams app
the pair mou also states that separate terms  agreed govern collaboration project
the parties like form strategic partnership exploring intersection technology healthcare further notes going descri hopes for a wide ranging collaborative relationship purposes advancing knowledge fields engineering life medical sciences research associated enterprise activities
sharing personally identifiable nhs patient data
the current framework handling sharing personally identifiable nhs patient data created after a review conducted  by fiona caldicott updated second review in  following concerns about how patient confidentiality  undermined increasing amounts of data sharing
nhs trusts supposed called caldicott principles account making decisions sharing personally identifiable patient data (pid originally principles focused minimizing pid shared effort allay concerns patient confidentiality undermined
 seventh added caldicott second report which seeks actively encourage appropriate data sharing described effort balance framework potential benefits patients of data sharing mind
the original caldicott principles state that the use/transfer patient identified data should  justified clearly defined scrutinized regularly reviewed use continues personally identifiable data  used unless alternative minimum possible personally identifiable data be used access personally identifiable data  strict need know basis handling data aware responsibilities vis vis patient confidentiality use personally identifiable data  lawful
the seventh principle adds duty share information  important duty protect patient confidentiality caldicott writing health social care professionals confidence share information best interests patients framework set principles  supported policies employers regulators professional bodies
while seventh principle might appear  opening door wide ranging data sharing agreements  royal free deepmind  caldicott march  review information governance of healthcare data does specifically note that direct patient care pertains care specific individuals 
only relevant information patient  shared professionals support care writes emphasis mine
while report describes indirect patient care encompassing activities contribute overall provision services population group patients particular condition
the phrase group patients particular condition suggests app like streams which is targeting medical condition appear  obviously categorized ‘indirect patient care’ based this framework
health services management preventative medicine medical research all fall indirect care according caldicott definition
examples activities  risk prediction stratification service evaluation needs assessment financial audit  review adds
despite caldicott examples direct vs indirect care royal free caldicott guardian dr killian hynes senior person responsible patient confidentiality appropriate data sharing trust claims  satisfied streams app constitutes direct patient care
in statement provided techcrunch hynes said
the royal free trust repeatedly declined answer dr hynes reviewed data sharing agreement deepmind prior patient data shared
the trust said that data protection officer  person signed data sharing agreement deepmind behalf trust  did so
if trust caldicott guardian (cg did review wide ranging data sharing agreement prior data shared deepmind question must  given that the caldicott principles urge process scrutiny trusts point of sharing personally identifiable data
the deepmind/royal free data sharing agreement currently being investigated by uk data protection watchdog acting small number public complaints
in statement provided techcrunch week ico confirmed continuing pro arrangement we continuing make enquiries relation matter organisation processing using people sensitive personal information accordance data protection act said
meanwhile last month techcrunch learned the streams app longer in use royal free clinicians  said run handful small user tests far
last month it emerged uk medicines healthcare regulator mhra contacted trust deepmind initiate discussions about whether app should  registered medical device the mhra informed streams app prior it being trialled
it worth pointing that the nhs information governance toolkit completed deepmind october signed data sharing agreement royal free self assessment process
deepmind said achieved highest possible rating on ig toolkit nhs provides party organizations assess processes its information governance standards deepmind self graded scores ig toolkit yet been audited the hscic according medconfidential
