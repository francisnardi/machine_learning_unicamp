codie makers reckon stand thanks effort putting proprietary visual programing language does require compiling time allows kids play coding actions real time touchscreen software also focus gestures help kids feel engaged with the visual coding process

we designed ground clear principles head startup tells techcrunch  intuitive touchscreen follow kids thinking imagination language developed goals mind created custom controls (eg setting color led ring kids define rgb codes  just simply set color visual color ring app users create programs opening keyboard
we integrating number coding elements codie application conditionals like  structures programming loops present example using structures create progr like ‘roomba’ codie gets info ultrasonic distance sensor makes decision codie continues path makes turn avoid collision loop decide process codie constantly avoid bumping objects
the te intending create cloud community codie users share programs kids to expand learning environment
to help kids develop graphical programming planning offer feature kids convert codie programs javascript
after editing js code convert codie interface familiar examine changes js code point wants  programmer learn specific programming knowledge but they learn programming patterns specific syntax programming language choice adds
