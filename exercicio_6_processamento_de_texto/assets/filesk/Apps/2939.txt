we deleting week got acquired/ran money familiar scene startup shuts down
it i’ve wondered users deserve data portability rights startups sign pledging way users access export poured company goes signed badge signaling commitment instill confidence users consider setting accounts
we data portability rights instead startups like stitch shutting instantly acquisition announced bitcoin service buttercoin telling users just days money  content subscription service tugboat yards telling creators stop processing monthly payments month acquired facebook
 luckily startups scruples voluntarily right people supported them today j shutting letting people share current favorite song 

in world constantly churning social media opinions recommendations j let say trust moment week listen seen  million jams shared  users  small working overtime serve granted attention
matthew ogle hannah donovan formed j music data giant echo nest   considered poor timing spun just months echo nest acquired spotify
usage slowed music streaming went fragmented mess web embeds unified app based streaming services fact timj web based resources develop mobile experience doomed languish finally founders code changes that services timj depended like youtu soundcloud twitter facebook hype machine echo nest and amazon
and ogle donovan singing swan song j moved product role personalization discovery spotify working product design lead music patronage subscription service drip

this j technologically remarkable destined  giant business  people trusted house endorsements of artistry that legit that company preserve shared it
rather pull plug entirely j  archived read mode september users wo  able post  listen old jams site spotify playlists i think  expected services shut down
 j going extra mile let users export jams likes info text lists read api stay available founders open sourcing service github case want replace opt having info archived set cute yearbook style quote eternal jam
it  tough think preserving past work  trying build future startups use final resources attempt success nicer funeral  developers respect users fail eventually harder ask people volunteer data effort make venture succeed
when i asked j te twitter care shutdown replied
j slow considerate sharing start  did want change giving back!
