a project probe the viability using low power bluetooth beacon technology aid for indoor navigation  special focus helping blind and visually impaired people independently  awarded  million grant googleorg broaden accelerate development
we covered ustworlsb joint venture august  team discussed their concept demoed a prototype working they’ve testing kit real world stations including london underground pimlico station february/march year going test london euston station wrap by the end year
the profit initiative has evolved the initial idea of building navigator app powered by beacon pings ambitious plan develop an open standard indoor audio navigation instructions the optimized arrangement bluetooth low energy beacons needed power it
the idea venues wanting embed indoor navigation hardware interiors and developers wanting include indoor navigation functionality apps will  able tap standard helping  hopefully  to accelerate the development of more accessible indoor navigation infrastructure resulting in a consistent experience people trying navigate different venues using multiple apps
what we’ve got grant doing creating open standard likes built environment owners… retailers… transport networks… advice standard… install maintain decide technology  using inside built environment says ustwo umesh pandya
also standard have… guidelines digital navigation services  people like google maps citymapper… instructions structure audio instruction  contained syntax communicating visually impaired people using audio based navigation
pandya reckons technology itself could wider applications groups  visually impaired  want help navigating new indoor venue as tourists example
the te hoping publish v of standards end q year

from onwards we’ll  looking trials really want attack unpack retail environment believe quite important believe  simple things retailers able to make existing beacon fleet accessible visually impaired  turn brings customers people able navigate stores adds
in terms likely timeframe real world deployments  following its beacon tech installation guidelines pandya says te hoping see a commitment start rollout complete network end  he means retail store entire transport network
i think far future adds beacons buy handsets bluetooth buy i think technology restrain  just organizational challenge
what saying  i’ve worked accessibility i’ve accessible apps products services  i learnt years  you bake beginning inclusive design approach does really cost minor compared bolting later ‘now need make product accessible’… build beginning minor cost
