people just excitement lately apple app store google play platform air hopelessness surrounds mobile app ecosystem obvious demoralizing
when i published app platforms (an app automatically monitored fuel economy driving i spent week obsessively checking download counts dreams grandeur dreams course came fruition time publish it  discovered
i echoed sentiment post year the lack app discoverability harms developers things help  post captured low odds app achieve success genuine impact broken app discovery mobile ecosystem
to illustrate ecosystem impact i dug apple app store data provided friends at mighty signal and mixrank charts
first set context let look average number apps released year complete year app store   new apps released month fast forward   new apps released month far be accelerating
despite more apps released month help surface new apps means developers having harder time getting app directly translates fewer downloads you plot average number ratings app year released historically ratings good proxy number downloads

in  average number ratings app was  times as high  means apps released  downloaded  times today ouch
what impact developers easier build app today versus early days similar work reward just does exist anymore this drives dramatic increase app abandonment

if app updated months chances actively worked i categorized abandoned abandoned apps i took time difference update release date determine long app actively worked gives app lifetime graph
as average developers released app  actively worked years abandoning apps released   abandoned months developers churning app store faster leaving abandoned apps behind
it easy graveyard fills using abandonment rate applying quantity new apps released


i know apple aware issue doing help developers rise noise let cross fingers hope way form of  improvements app store search and  rumored app store promoted search results
