basics
pros
cons

design
in recent years smartphone hardware design converged adopt slab shaped template  unsurprisingly interesting stuff large responsive touchscreen acting canvas software running lets do any alternative hardware form factors  sliders physical qwerty keyboards  just way limitation software the main smartphone design trend past years screens bigger allow prodding
jolla phone startup talk doing things differently does buck trend  presenting user rectangle slab touchscreen glass act playground albeit relatively modest size current palm stretching standards little larger current crop iphone screens though
the main hardware design flare sandwich form factor slab created backplate pushed body phone edge pieces meet leaves continuous se little extra grip hold phone test device i using came white backplate contrasting black attractive tone look

if brightly coloured phones thing options select boldly coloured half (as backplate known batch jolla handsets launched finnish carrier dna bright pink rear jolla started selling aloe green half website black option want stand look
the backplates just adding splash colour include nfc support link software allowing particular colour backplate change theme colours os (for instance potentially support implementations preloaded digital content music album sort use cases jolla hoping encourage
it has also released d files half sdk encourage developers modding backplates power (and bus connector incorporated phone backplate snaps  possible half include sophisticated additional hardware functionality qwerty keyboard e ink screen (not possible halves built   hooks extending platform ways ready waiting

the handset casing plastic  does feel premium metal/glass clad devices like iphone htc device  jolla attention aspects hardware design mixture rounded edges smooth blunt ones gloss logo invisibly inked matt backplate jumps reflective view tilt device design confident sure footed air and help to elevate overall look feel plebian plastic android hoards attempting disrupt
similarly aesthetic touches evident aspects software jolla calendar app subtle flip animation turns sunday monday scroll dual dial interface jolla clock app setting timer positioning glowing beads concentric circles understated double tap gesture  used wake phone sleep distinct design flare evident
size wise (and weight wise jolla phone good middle ground screen showcase content playing big actual device  unwieldy said you’ve already pushed past  inch phablet mark personal mobile device you’ll probably miss extra space way street mobile phone screen inflation goes
os
what really new course sailfish os  carries meego heritage jolla took nokia startup core te left carry developing platform nokia abandoning favour making leap microsoft windows phone
as platform meego plenty promise  timing terrible nokia outted n (way  android pushing ahead rest field jolla gap android  gulf industry placed os windows phone (which kept afloat redmond deep pockets remains bit player android saturated universe
realistically sailfish stands chance achieving mass market penetration   really positioned jolla appeal serving non mainstre margins aka fringe folk dissatisfied vanilla looking orthodox flavour people bored functional similarity android ios microsoft branded alternative non mainstre alternative

that necessarily smaller modest market  niche market  remains  seen outside jolla native stamping ground finland national pride nokia fuelled nostalgia help buoy jolla little boat sailfish greatest chance building scale likely  east china  region early focus startup
however jolla concentrated launch handset europe (and finland far appears rowed talk strong early push china  follow  announcement distribution deal chinese retailer dphone momentum east story currently tell implied potential of the previously announced hong kong based sailfish alliance ergo sailfish eastern promise remains  seen
features
what exactly different sailfish os jolla phone interface built series gestures  pulling screen typically brings contextual menu view simultaneously incorporates selector bar fluid movement used point select action menu  depending when/where release finger instance email app ‘compose new email’ ‘update’ actions reside just screen pull menu
the advantage type drag interface perform actions (single finger movement having lift tap potentially time/efficiency savings plus ability control os single digit forced use hands navigate certain groups users dexterity issues disability affecting hands/arms sailfish navigation  bit challenging tap happy mainstre mobile options
another aspect sailfish navigation built swipes a swipe screen brings events/notification screen swiping left right used close app currently  partially close (if pause gesture mid way allowing peek home screen reverse gesture app follow minimize land homescreen
why want peek homescreen contains series minimised apps displayed like deck cards containing glimpses active content allowing new email inbox instance glimpse latest content website
for native sailfish apps built jolla browser support functional interaction right homescreen card  refresh webpages trigger open new webpage just dragging finger left right browser card similarly pause/play music media homescreen card on
at granular point sailfish interface resemble russian doll nested gestures user takes time to know short cuts interface certainly potential feel fluid productive  flip gestural layers incremental short cuts end piling confusing possible navigation options atop os resulting steep learning curve sailfish newcomer
beyond user education challenge sailfish reliance gestures problems main problem swipe gesture mis register back/forth swipes used multiple menu screens apps vice versa end closing app just trying to screen doing reverse
misregistered actions like serve confuse navigation disadvantage different mobile mainstre involves aforementioned disadvantageous learning curve
knowing swipe pull reach menus  obvious user know  look sailfish visual cues  glowing bar screen small glowing dots indicate number additional screens available swiping to

add times  intuitively  feel  able simply reverse swipe action just did reverse path return screen just you ca  instead pull retrace original steps contextual menu
there logic  exactly taking path resistance user point view interface feel better/easier  just different  irritating
the navigation does away taps entirely  does mean need tap confirm action pulling bring contextual menu  clear need to proceed ergo confusion
the functions supported homescreen cards getting used especially non native sailfish apps (such android apps compatible device include support gestures native apps additional gestures resort signposting lack  written instruction card ‘tap continue’  avoid user confusion support gestural interaction  having sub optimal (and potentially introduces procedural confusion apps include signpost text
the card based homescreen potentially richer alternative icons ios android size cards limit functionality portals going apps jolla phone supports deck cards displayed screen cards size shrinks text/content displayed  tricky make cards far useable larger  screen (as pictured left  allowing content  displayed comfortably gestural interaction  fiddly
as ‘glanceable’ interface jolla phone homescreen shares blackberry   panel ‘active frames  palm webos lesser extent windows phone info displaying live tiles sailfish support gestural interaction homescreen cards does things little live tiles ability adds significantly interface better described incremental benefit depends apps use sort actions regularly perform
if instance checking particular webpage regularly refreshing inbox new content able perform actions right homescreen having dive app  boon  little hard shake feeling usability benefit relatively incremental new email going to inbox read   ios static icon based homescreen sticks little red digit email icon telling time check in
one area jolla delivered really usable slice software native sailfish keyboard touchscreen keyboard incorporates scrollable word suggestion bar qwerty layout offers evolving rack words choose typing

the typing time savings  considerable multiple word suggestions fit screen chances right cropping you’ve finished spelling good plus words lurk just screen pull quick swipe bar
it great use available (and implied screen screen real estate support smarter kind touchscreen keyboard better static old iphone keyboard absolutely!
apps
jolla built series terms essential apps phone download set process snag direct jolla store later include basics media player email maps (powered nokia calendar clock notes calculator documents viewer etc
this jolla filling sailfish platform gap  new kid mobile block  unable rely substantial party developer ecosystem it

essential synonym ‘basics jolla sailfish apps really bare bones mobile user expect standard smartphone want ambitions apps  really modern mobile user does  ephemeral messaging insanely frustrating gaming sailfish going  able deliver own
there handful native sailfish apps developers jolla available download jolla store  including jolla essentials  apps total jolla store total right  includes plenty simple stuff like age calculator app kitchen timer torch apps plus apps evidently ported android sailfish app ecosystem clearly remains nascent
jolla solution app gap  accurately ‘app gulf’ vs android ios  add pipeline android ecosystem allow sub set apps  siphoned platform compatibility android the preloaded hub android apps jolla device is yandex app store  holds  android apps downloading extend device functionality
jolla users download android app stores (ie addition yandex store access additional android apps  google play ecosystem obviously limits
jolla line android app ecosystem inelegant fix platform wanted provide entirely alternative mobile reality  platform lags mobile category leader circa million+ apps necessary compromise pragmatism means jolla device gets needed leg app stakes vs smaller players trying crack android/ios duopoly (such mozilla html web apps approach firefox os
it trouble free compromise though the main problem approach  ignoring core philosophical having incorporate thing dislike (including having tolerate android navigation keys cropping android apps sprinkle additional confusion alternative navigation  android apps  run smoothly sailfish os environment
this true i did hands jolla phone november true  big bug evident android runtime spontaneously taking interface appears sorted app compatibility issues ongoing problem though
many android apps  including yandex app store  run sluggishly noticeable lag some android apps unstable installation  skype instance stopped responding moment use (  fair skype app pretty universally terrible regardless mobile platform accessing from plus certain actions android apps supported sailfish  triggers dialogue box try ca informing such action possible price compromise
 android apps work line dominant ecosystem does help expand jolla experience users providing access lot app ‘essentials  facebook twitter cut rope particular app poison just long expect flappy bird viral hit  natively spawned sailfish platform
performance
some performance issues jolla phone clearly directly associated android emulator feature laggy apps discussed above
more general handset performance issues affect jolla phone likely relate effectively (on paper chunk pretty mid range smartphone hardware
the handset powerhouse processor stakes  certainly today flagship phone standards (which problems having long development time device market jolla relative lack horsepower translates overall performance tendency feel bit plodding
there times interface noticeable lag  taking photo watching shot you’ve just snapped slide screen (off screen camera roll delay huge  noticeable
likewise browser feel little underpowered tackling certain websites little slow scroll respond taps transitions type content loading require spot micro patience user
the response time lag pronounced running (some android apps noted above

native sailfish apps fair better you’d expect  overall performance issue  aforementioned paucity scarcity app quantity quality
elsewhere performance handset rear camera distinctly mid range photos lack crisp clarity lens struggles variable light levels likewise handset qhd screen far pin sharp aspects jolla phone distinctly mid range
battery life does pretty good standby active use phone easily manage day normal use needing recharge 
bottom line
the jolla phone gesture based interface steep learning curve newbies considering embedded mobile users android/ios navigation paradigms inevitably pushing water hill floating new platform long android ios set sail means sailfish ca hope compete quantity native apps  attracting hoards developers tough ask deliver high quality party native apps either
that huge app gap means jolla forced tether dingy android leviathan it trying circumvent  extend reach dinky sailfish ecosystem hopes building sustainable momentum practical pragmatic strategy  ongoing compromise muddies new platform clear blue waters
