artists beware! ai coming paintbrush too… new ios app called prisma using deep learning algorithms turn smartphone photos stylized artworks based different artwork/graphical styles
snap choose your photo select ‘art filter’  applied wait as the app works algorithmic magic  returning stylized image in a matter seconds options share social networks
so you’ve wanted bedroom to resemble rotoscope animation selfie shades manga hopeless sketching skills hold yearning create a web comic prisma definitely app you…
 
 
prisma was launched only last week  garnered some  million downloads ceo founder alexey moiseenkov tells techcrunch phone moscow te currently based
the key this early growth clearly app prominently placed social share function prompts users post instagr soon as they receive processed shot
and just this week facebook owned photo sharing behemoth revealed it doubled monthly active users over the past two years  reaching a whopping  million maus lot selfies outfits lunches cute pet shots being shared instagr day day some  million photos videos shared platform on the average day
the size instagr network is obviously creating massive pull fresh content pull that prisma evidently able tap into by offering fresh set filters hungry insta hoards prisma using instagr users apparently badging art filtered shots #prisma hashtag
a lot people share photos hashtag i know hashtag  magic i think jokes moiseenkov day day launch create  photos instagr like boom! day hashtag ours
prisma offering around  art filters inside app point art/graphical starting points including the scre edvard munch baroque roy lichtenstein dc comic graphic plus abstract artworks like transverse line wassily kandinsky

more filter options added time with moiseenkov saying intention add day point
after month  styles says
the aim presumably is to try avoid its stylized looks feeling stale novelty lose sheen exciting newness quickly grabbed people attention place  prisma the honeymoon phrase right now
while ca real time effect a prisma filter given wait short shot  processed quick does feel arduous   addictive as end trying more filters photo just going look like which may scale  options app
here example the filter effects look applied to the photo…
results vary depending subject matter lighting conditions course certain filters producing better results shot  experience testing app rarely returned result looked like artwork gone wrong (darker lighting conditions did sometimes confuse filters
most time processed imagery comes looking impressively pro moodily atmospheric processing time  seconds albeit continue scale user base they’ll need beef servers up
all processing is cloud on the te servers than on device but moiseenkov notes retaining parsing users original photos
we storing original photos know sent photos know photo non readable format store result time network bad want reconnect result phone says
in terms core tech moiseenkov says te is using neural network/deep learning algorithms process the photos
on server like neural networks today perform different task based like extract style artwork apply photo tricks speed process
neural networks are necessary prisma art filters actually filters says moiseenkov  the imagery created blank canvas  using data inputs generate a final image
we just overlaying like instagr filter create photo scratch photo took photo perform operations new photo deep learning like artist like that
the original idea app came moiseenkov saw similar algorithm online process photos style artworks problem was very slow
it took  minutes hour says  i  mobile i want result i want wait long time i think i improve it
for months just polishing idea math centre april just months create production code
they launched app countries initially in about   countries getting  installs across  markets per day biggest splash russia far you’d expect given te hails   planning relocate san francisco building prisma

additional features coming app short term will include automatically suggesting best filters particular shot based objects image certainly  way better navigate having as  filters choose from
they also plans video with moiseenkov saying processing technique can still work quickly mobile video scenario
photos start plan add like boomerang app instagr like short cycles plan add near future  i think july sort clever filters quality  superb adds
they intending to work more features boost user engagement  te illusions trying build network/platform piece of cool tech
prisma processing is feature doing right feeding social platforms big need image processing it seems like sort tech generate an acquisition approach te line talent aqui hire
there lot platforms need social networks today agrees moiseenkov adding hard simple app  sustainable i think success simplicity  just photo choose filter result i think great way user result share artwork
before app needed sort time like hour photoshop hours website service just going outside park friends just create sort like art amazing
 
the prisma te attracted external investment supporting development  moiseenkov able disclose details stage
one investors mycom/mailru group previously announced it putting money with dmitry grishin chairman board commenting in statement artificial intelligence neural network bring lot change types media content happy support startups continue investments perspective trend further’
the prisma ios app free download monetization end going route involve offering sponsored filters  likely route pushing in app purchases users reckons moiseenkov
i know  lot enquiries big companies i time talk adds
