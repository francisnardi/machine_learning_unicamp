move t machine new automated tinder hack town  does just dumbly swipe right every potential date like drunk trying undo shoelaces got visual smarts thanks eigenfaces algorithm that analyzes facial features of potential mate  likes dislikes each based previously expressed aesthetic choices basically hello tinder + machine learning!
the software created vancouver based developer justin long detailing project in blog long notes got fed manual swiping tinder  decided  smarter tech powered fix tedium/sore thumbs did just indiscriminately swipe like t machine et al decided add in facial recognition algorithms intelligent auto sorting
he writes built version called tinderbox weeks pulling tinder apis to recreate tinder app experience browser faces cropped suitable profile pictures (smaller shots wo work course compared average face representing sum human user aesthetic choices yes these amalgams definitely check ‘uncanny valley’ box…

long notes user required make  yes/no choices bot data choose behalf   tinder auto pilot yikes!
 wait more! tinder bot start conversations potential mates  thanks long implementing natural language processing tech to power a conversation starter messaging feature help user weed matches who actually (perhaps swiping right everyone
he writes
which does really pose question happens tinderbox algorithm encounters chat machine machine exchange result algorithmic love byte feedback loop cause kind marginless error takes tinderbox action leaving human instigator forced resort thumbs  speculate…
(update asked long confirms (yet tried algo algo  says gut feeling burn quickly stalemate notes messages pre set  auto generated adds failure to swap pre set messages let female friend try bot resulted  men tinder being asked teach guy bake just goes human error  hugely amplified automation
one thing sure future algorithmic dating going involve pretty weird conversation openers (although mate seeking humans let loose dating apps are quite capable as tinderfessions amply illustrates
what happened long relationship tinderbox turns went steady things good good point distraction kicked algorithmic habit  does say he went on  dates based tinderbox choices couple cases says follow ups  apparently seeing person despite revealing machine powered pick methods fascinating conversation*…
long adds
reader created dashboard really taking procreation evolution level
so long partner by thumb power stumbled different human is alas unanswerable question algorithm parsing parallel universes  yet
the code tinderbox available personal use modification github long says does not currently plans pursue project commercially undoubtedly some other developer will
update interestingly long tells techcrunch faces (around + pushes algorithm breaking point  the ‘yes model ‘no’ model converge says adding indicate limits algorithm different strategy needed long term
another problem algorithm powered mate matching is the prevalence instagr et al filters making harder bot distinguish faces properly
the bot produced spectrum looks reason eigenfaces algorithm focuses facial features skin color body type say i did look adding features algorithm problem photos used filters probably instagr difficult normalize i time i’d probably  little comprehensive adds
he told techcrunch girlfriend say the algorithmic truth actually thought really cool! helped was ‘swipe all’ scenario bot meant seek just i pick says adding  honest i surprised women positive reaction it novel actually meant ‘ myself’ matches filtered tinderbox entirely meant  passed user i think  dystopian person ask date
*a note long github page includes helpful caveat tool automates lot tinder experience  forewarned appreciates met robot
